Surely, you don't really mean that the Church's ban on homosexuals is as firm as its ban on women as priests? \n\nAt the level of practice, surely the exact opposite is true. There are no women currently active as priests or being accepted into seminaries, but the number of gay priests is estimated as high as 50%  of the present clergy, and probably is continuing to increase. Even if the reality is lower (say around 35%?) still the proportion of gay priests is way higher that the proportion of gay men in the population. \n\nSince you know this, I presume you mean something different?

I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and \"objectifying women\".

The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

Under her the DA began losing the liberal values it held under her predecessors, and for her combativeness, self-righteousness and superiority, which most politicians have, incl Maimane and her critics.

Presumably God Almighty could raise Jesus regardless of his human condition post mortem.\n\n<<there's NO defense for his ludicrous claim>>\n\nYes, there is, as I mentioned before. Crossan may be wrong, but he didn't dream up this stuff in a vacuum. If the Romans permitted Jesus's body to be removed from the cross before sundown on the day of his crucifixion, it would (probably) have been unusual. Even if the Romans deferred to Jewish sensibilities over crucifixion victims, they may have been less accommodating when it came to seditionists. The whole point of the public spectacle was to discourage insurgents and terrify the populace into submission.",

Like most old hippies, I find something in me that responds to that sort of nostalgia.\n\nThe reality, however, is that the United States, as it currently exists, cannot survive in anything like its current state if it permits powerful foreign combinations to form against it--e.g., China dominating all of East Asia, or Russia intimidating Europe.  On the eve of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles told the Athenians: \"Nor is it any longer possible for you to give up this empire … Your empire is now like a tyranny: it may have been wrong to take it; it is certainly dangerous to let it go.\"  Our empire is quite different in character, consisting more of hundreds of pressure points than of broad territory, but the sentiment still fits.",

Our state spending since 1980 or so has been based on billions earned from the oil revenue. We are trying to replace with an income tax. I don't really know how to make a spreadsheet but without a really high tax rate, we won't be able to replace the lost revenue until we all pay the taxes at the same rate......flat tax for everyone....not just for the rich or upper middle class but for the poor. Ditch the PDF concept. Taxing the poor sounds cruel and crude but its an effective barrier for \"tax and spend\" politicians. Hawaii got double our population. They got state income tax, sales tax, their mills for property tax is very high and every year, they paid several hundreds dollars for car registration. And there are more surcharges for this, for that. City of Honolulu also got taxes.....and everyone pays...rich to the poor!!! Most liberal state!!!",

Conversely, without society, the division of labour would not be possible, which precludes trade, which leaves us at a pre-historic level of individual subsistence. Society might be a collection of free individuals, rather than an abstract entity that ought to be directed and controlled, but without society, free-market capitalism could not exist.",

There is lots of land designated for detached and semi-detach housing, but until all the services are in, the municipality has approved the development and, the big one actually issued building permits, that land is not available. \nBTW, there is absolutely nothing wrong with buying condominiums for rental purposes.  In fact, over the last 5 years about 60% of all condos have been purchased for rental purposes in the GTA (see CMHC data).  Without the condos there would be almost no new rental housing.

This is very uncommon in the industry I work in, and i've spent more time in hotels for work then I wish I had. Any decent hotel has a restaurant or conference rooms that are specifically set up for business meetings. There is absolutely no excuse for anyone to have a business meeting in a hotel room and the union should strictly enforce this.\n\nRegarding the union: You are paying dues so that you can work in a safe environment.

The Association, who dialogued with opponents of the CCIQ project, does not want a mosque to own exclusively a cemetery, because of a previous experience with a Muslim cemetery in Laval, left as a dump by the mosque that owns it.

PMs making the best of bad hands - as Harper did during the global melt down - tend to be trusted by the electorate and get re-elected.  Those who make the worst of bad hands lose their economic credibility and the trust of Canadians and are punished at the polls.\n\nTrudeau 1.0 played his economic and fiscal hands disastrously and voters outside Quebec got wise to this and lost trust in his economic stewardship.  So he squeaked in by just 2 seats in 1972, lost in 1979, and doomed the Liberals to defeat in 1984.\n\nTrudeau 2.0 seems to be following his father`s course and therefore can expect the same result.",

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

The simple fact is that UAA students themselves don't support their own sports teams--so why should anyone else ?  Just begging people to show up for games isn't enough . They need to make going to the games fun , which right now they aren't.  At Aces games all the fans hang out and visit with each other between periods , making it fun. At UAA games many fans run off and go behind a restricted area for free popcorn and beer creating a divide between fans.  The elites think they are too good to mingle with everyone else . That makes UAA games less fun than Aces games. Who's the fool in charge that decided to show home games on TV ?  Why pay to go to games when you can see them for free on TV ?

Per earlier comment made in recent past,  \"It doesn’t help that enforcement is lacking per the excerpt from our Neighborhood Board #5 minutes, “Chair  West added that CSD has 43,000 mopeds on record and HPD will not use a lack of license plate or registration stickers as a reason to stop mopeds but will check registration and licensing on mopeds during other stops.”   What would determine “other stops” was not clarified.  Personally, it seems the number of mopeds that should have been addressed by this law has not diminished.  I continue to “hear”  them up and down Waialae (fill in the blank of your street) and observe many that do not have a moped license.  Few mopeds have a license and they're rather noticeable so HPD cannot use \"not visible enough\" as an excuse.  I guess HPD opts to determine what is law and what is not.  Sad.",

This is fine if they can defeat it with the Byrd Rule or can put a VAT in now to at least partially repeal the high unearned-income taxes, leaving the other provisions to die by amendment.

Yes, local governments are not tasked with enforcing a federal laws, but that's not what they're doing. The Sheriff's Department is simply notifying another law enforcement agency about a detainee's presence. This type of cooperation between agencies happens all the time and is within their power and authority. Of course it is also not a local city government's place to decide matters of US domestic policy, so who's really stepping outside their jurisdiction here?

Yet they did exactly that. Ahtna will pursue whatever means (Fed Subsistence Board & Board of Game) to get what they want: a preference.

These requirements seem very reasonable and I can think of no reason to object to these requirements other than to protect non-citizens that are in the country illegally.

Good luck saving up for that with Gov Canada 10 year bonds paying 2% interest! Then subtract 2% annual inflation!\nAnd what about couples that are divorced? Did you know that alimony is a SPRINKLING thing too. Yes, that's right. A person earning $200,000 per year who has to pay alimony will be taxed at a rate of $100,000 per partner PLUS they get double the RRSP room!!\nMaybe it's time we start looking at household income for ALL CANADIANS and stop allowing politicians to strategically buy votes with our money!",

People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other.

As to where the line between those two might be set in a satisfactory way, I suspect that point varies by individual, and over time. And THAT'S where trust, or lack of it, comes to play.  I think the author of the article is correct in the 3 numbered points in the article: the church's leadership has very much earned our skepticism. I suspect that in many/most human relationships, after there is an injury, it takes more that just time to repair.

Wilson did everything possible to keep us out but the Zimmerman telegraph to Mexico by German Ministry, and unrestricted U-boat warfare even against neutrals forced his hand. Any series defending Henry C. Lodge is way off track.\n\nWilson gets it from both sides of the current ideological extremes these days. The left and activists hate him for his race views and actions. The hard right hates him for the Fed. Reserve, the FTC, progressive taxation, and other progressive laws. In the spring of 1917 Wilson offered to arbitrate an end to the horrors of WW One. The combatants (notably UK) ignored him.",

He did seem capable of admitting that the church makes mistakes, which many hierarchs still cannot.  Benedict’s 2 greatest gifts to the church, IMO, was the statement that the pope CAN’T do whatever he wants (a subtle dig at Paul VI & Pio IX), and his demonstration that a pope can resign, which re-set a precedent that I hope many future pontiffs will follow.\nV2 has been over for 50 years.

I-70 made travel to each easier, faster, and without overloading surface streets. I-70 was built to keep traffic close to Denver, not to push the main east-west route several miles away from it, making travel times and distance longer.\n\nDenver wouldn't look the same if I-70 had been built across Adams County.

Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997).\"\nSurveys have consistently reported that college men acknowledged forced intercourse at a rate of 5-15% and college sexual aggression at a rate of 15-25% (Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski, 1987; Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, and Tanaka, 1991).\nThe national survey of rape conducted by Koss et al.

Just in the last 20 years well over a hundred GOP elected officials have been caught committing sex crimes. Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing. Nobody is pretending there is less sex on the left -but leftists don't try to legislate anything beyond 'consensual adults'. There's no hypocrisy in being gay or divorced on the left.

A difference in 5000 miles not driven/year means $hundreds in gas savings, $hundreds more in maintenance cost saved, and good chance of $thousands in parking costs averted.  And that doesn't even count the biggest savings -- delaying the need for spending tens of $thousands to replace the vehicle as quickly.

Jesus often invited tax collectors and sinners to dine with him including women. Women would play a significant role the next few days.\nThe cross is a symbol of suffering that all of who follow Jesus must face in our lives. And with it we will find the love of God and transformation into spiritual life.\nI just can't see God asking for his son's death as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Maybe your view of God requires it? But the God Jesus presents as His Father is love, mercy and forgiveness. God already sees mankind with love. God doesn't need a sacrifice.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

What are the possibilities for art on an empty pedestal?”\n\nI think this is a powerful idea.  Even better, for many of the Robert E. Lee statues for example, would be to remove the rider from the horse and leave the statue of the riderless horse.  It leaves an impression of an instrument of power and movement being leaderless, which has been a problem in Southern States for decades.",

The Legislature is a prime example of this in its lack of ETHICS, its perks, per diem, travel, etc.\n   We have BigOIl with some of its toads in high positions in the Senate.\n   We have growing socialism focused primarily on \"the most vulnerable\" rather than the most productive elements of society. In concert with that are the unions & employees of the agencies supporting the most vulnerable - i.e. Medicaid expansion, drug & alcohol rehab, etc.\n   Bottom line is, Ak must cut expenses. The greatest expenses are Salaries & Benefits of govt. employees, health care, education. Then drastically pare down the Legislature's budget.",

Some things I like to see and touch before I would buy, furniture is one of these things.  If I do need to go on-line, I would be comparing prices so Walmart likely to loses a sale if its missing in the store.  What really needs to happen to save costs for all retailers to compete against on-line merchants is that retail property taxes and rents need to be lowered to warehouse standards, or warehouses the likes of Amazon's need to be taxed more.  As well I would support smaller retailers having lower property taxes to have a fairer playing field for retailers.",

Even in this the first episode, Einstein's walking around life reveals a tension I've ignored.  The parallel's to  today's authoritarian (nationalist populist) actions in America were, chilling. I know these films are in production long before we see them, however the timing adds an element of parable to those with ears to hear.

Oakes presents an incidental Charter conflict test relating to a very specific pre-existing provision in the criminal code, but neither it nor N.S is as relevant or analogous to the Quebec face veil ban as is Keegstra, which addresses the specific issue of whether a deliberately legislated infringement of a fundamental right can be upheld where an important and overriding societal objective is argued to justify the infringement.",

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

I just don't see it, especially once a few months of Trump tweets and actual Trump management in power have gone by (remember Trump hasn't had to actually manage or lead anything yet where he is responsible to others).  Running a business vs a govt are miles apart.  \nSecond, not speaking French is a big issue, it shouldn't be, but it is.  PQ will love that.  More Quebec battles?\nThird, not sure how O'Leary - Kenney comparison makes any sense.  Kenney is a real social conservative, not O'Leary.  Kenney is seeking power where there is a traditional conservative base, O'Leary less so.  Kenney has no business skills, but an excellent ground game of young bootstrappers for ground game support.

He was quite humiliated by the audience and the host, and essentially told to \"educate\" himself. The usual advice was also given by the host at the end of the show - if your doctor doesn't agree with this, get a new doctor who does. \n\nI had trouble with this issue as a FP too. I remember being told in the 1980s by a well-respected palliative care physician that narcotics were not addictive if the pain was genuine.

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

Sherbrooke Mayor Jean Perrault, president of the federation, stated, \"This U.S. protectionist policy is hurting Canadian firms, costing Canadian jobs and damaging Canadian efforts to grow in the world-wide recession.\" On February 16, 2010, the United States and Canada agreed on exempting Canadian companies from Buy American provisions, which would have hurt the Canadian economy.\"",

The 1953 Concordat with Franco in Spain provided that a bishop could only be put on trial in a civil court with the consent of the Vatican, and priests with the consent of the bishop.  The trial, if agreed to, was not to be publicised. The 1973 concordat with Colombia still provides that bishops can only be tried by the canonical Courts. Priests on the other hand can be tried in State Courts but the proceedings are not to be publicised. I am not aware of any similar concordat with other South American countries. One of the reasons for the imposition of secrecy under canon law, in my opinion, is that the same result could be achieved by a cover up in countries unsympathetic to similar concordats. If the State did not know about these crimes, the matter could be dealt with exclusively in the canonical courts.",

It think Jesus could only take things so far - and women could also only take things so far.  I also think that women probably played a greater role during the life of Jesus but it is written about by MML&J, all males, and the later writers - also all male - out of a male point of view.  It was also written decades after the death of Jesus and as the Church was forming, so it was written in a way that would make it possible to be taken seriously and written to make sense to those who would read it.  \n\nThe role of women in the world has changed dramatically and it is not going back.  Regardless of whether or not there were female religious leaders in the past, the social/cultural place of women today is not what it was in the past.  That affects not just the roles they have outside the Church, but also their roles inside the Church.",

My contention (see The Empty Christ of Philippians: Mahāyāna Meditations) is that emptying self is the main idea. The mind of Christ empties selfhood, which is why we are to take on this mind. The ancient and medieval substance theologies were skillful in their times, but today hardly anyone embraces their categories as live options for us. So many theologians are attempting to rethink the mind (and nature) of Christ \"from below,\" i.e, from a phenomenally sensitive approach. Start with the gospel Jesus, not with Greek ontology.",

No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

The only way to fully understand the concept is to understand it as the founders did by reading the great philosophers chiefly John Locke.\n\nWhy would man in his natural state consent to a government that does not first offer him protection and equal opportunity?

People were dying for unexplained reasons even back then.

Kids were lacing marijuana when I was young with PCP. Fentanyl is a drug of choice for lacing because it is so CHEAP. \nBAN Fentanyl NOW is my opinion.

That comment you made is blaming her for being drunk.  People have a right to be drunk if they want (or even naked) and no one, NO ONE has the right to use this as an excuse to rape them!\n\nRead Blatchford's take on this.

People can b/s with mathematical models just as well. As you point out, Malikane's piece was not an academic piece and the only reason people took it seriously is because he is an academic. My argument exactly is that we shouldn't listen to him based on only this.\n2. You write I claim that \"“people should not trust economists I think are bogus, which obviously doesn’t include me, my co-authors, patrons, friends, etc” but I did not say anything like that.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

But the effects of quickly raising the minimum wage to this level could be quite problematic. Small businesses will be particularly hard hit. Also, low-wage workers could suffer, as has been the case in Seattle, where businesses absorbed the initial wage hike in the graduated scheme implemented in that city, but eventually as the wage level increased further staffing was cut back and the precariously employed reportedly ended up getting fewer hours and less income. So my advice would be to implement the minimum wage more gradually, at not more than $1/hr per year, and examine the impacts before proceeding with further large increases.

Less people means a smaller economy, less cross-pollination of ideas and fewer opportunities for economies of scale. There's a reason why immigration isn't just supported by big business but by parties of all stripes, because we can only pay for stuff if we're earning enough compared to other countries.\nPersonally, I'd rather be able to afford an HTC phone made in Taiwan, a PS4 made in Japan, a ThinkPad made in China, and maybe someday a Tesla made in the USA. If that means giving up a piece of arable land in return, I'm quite okay with that.\nImmigration keeps importing young, hardworking people whose taxes and demographics sustain our welfare system. We get them for free without having to pay for any of their daycare or decade-long education. All we need to do for this is to give them a spot in society. I think that's a good trade-off.",

They could all be wrong that human activity has anything to do with it, but I think I'd  be  paying more attention to independent science than the understandably self-protective stance of old-economy industry. Climate change and  economic and business trends alike can move haltingly until the 'tipping point' finally is passed, and then all the deniers inevitably join the 'why didn't somebody tell me' camp. \n\nWhat's not to like about cleaner city air and quiet streets of new transportation technologies? I think I'd be changing my 'weighting' just in case.",

Sometimes they don't, and the assailant they let escape ends up killing an unarmed robbery victim a short while later.\n\nCarrying a firearm for protection is not a no-brainer. You do have to train yourself, and consider the possible outcomes and your willingness to undergo them. Shooting someone, even a thief or murderer, carries a huge cost psychologically and financially, even if you are clearly in the right.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

As you know, those two Xs in the seal stand for the double cross of Oregon's and California's politicians.  One can see and feel the anger all around. The old ways are no longer working.

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

This includes 583 civilians, 398 rebels and 153 soldiers and militiamen allied with the government. Of the 583 civilian deaths, 130 were caused by rebel shellings on western Aleppo. Simply put, that's a modest casualty level in the circumstances.

That if the state were to go ahead and honor those contracts and the step increases also that we'd no longer be worrying about raises but the jobs themselves. \nListen to this guy now.\nPete feels no need to apologize or defend his salary, and I'll be damned if I feel like I need to defend mine from him. \nHe and I are both state employees yet he must be the special kind because he makes 3 times as much as I do for per diem. \nThis guy has always struck me as an arrogant ass and this type of reaction just reinforces the feeling.\nIt's fine for Mr. Fiscal Con to demand I make sacrifices and do my part and furlough some time but mention the same to Kelly and he says you can do what you want, he's got nothing to apologize for and won't start now.\nThis is the best you have Fairbanks?",
