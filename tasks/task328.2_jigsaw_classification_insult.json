They'd probably even call that terrorism, \"defending freedom\" so their own ignorant citizens will disregard the fact over a million innocent civilians were killed, over nothing.

Trump said that he was considering breaking up the banks and establishing a gas tax. He said that he would be \"honored\" to meet with North Korea dictator Kim Jong-Un, and then said that \"nobody's safe\" from North Korea's nuclear weapons. And to top things off, Trump praised the high approval ratings of Philippines strongman President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      He's a weak and unstable ignorant buffoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          That's the explanation.",

Of course, many judges refuse to do that because they appear to be terrified of the prospect of a rebuke from an appeal court.

But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

When pastors (and denominations) remove Jesus from the centre of preaching, make the study and understanding of the Bible irrelevant, and cherry-pick what is to be considered sinful (or won't discuss sin at all), people starve for spiritual nourishment. These congregations become primarily a social entity and invariably many, many cannot sustain themselves and close their doors. The crux of it is that people need to hear how only the God of the Bible, through Jesus alone, grants us forgiveness, gives us authentic purpose, meaning, love and a future with Him for eternity. When humankind develops its own solutions for these deep human needs apart from God, the solutions are invariably temporary and often harmful.

Pope Francis, and the UN Declaration of Human Rights say health care is a right, and not a privilege that comes with wealth.  When you say it’s not a right, you reduce an essential of life to just another commodity to be bought and sold in the marketplace.  It might be good business, but it is barbaric and most definitely is not Christian.

So that's the occasion the professor chose to do this?

Laws that are not enforced are simply ignored and that is why we have 11+ million illegals in our country demanding amnesty. \nThe American people are fed up with illegal immigration and Donald Trump is President as a reaction to this corrupt situation.",

Before, deductibles were $500 to $1000. \n\nMore people are covered and the insurance companies get roughly $1000-$1200 per person per month either from you or subsidies. Given your deductibles, you still have to come up with your deductible before the insurance kicks in. Great, your covered, but you still have to pay.\n\nFrom a high level, more people are still covered, but many of those people still can't afford to use it.

Zero tax deduction or other economic benefit is provided for private school child.   Yet, the government affiliated OIA targets Hawaii citizens, and children no less, in an effort to PREVENT their increased and ostensibly earned participation in a school based activity.    Why?  Jealousy and resentment.  Two things we NEVER want to be the basis for governmental action.  Yet, in this case, those things are clearly at play, and the government actors are openly denying citizens access.   Yes.

The balance of nature becomes disturbed when the less elusive \"rabbit\" is introduced into nature.  They are easier game for predators to catch because they don't have the instinct and blending ability that hares do.  Example of this is a black rabbit in the snow.  It might freeze but it can be seen!  What happens is the snowshoe hare becomes overpopulated because they are harder to catch by prey animals.  This leads to damage or loss of eatable items to support new hares.  Voila! When the starvation occurs what happens to the predators that have eaten all the rabbits and the hares have starved which decreases the population for predators to eat!  Make sense?",

Poloz, like Greenspan before him, would have us believe this is just a local, not a national problem. We are supposed to be relaxed, because there is no housing price surge in Calgary or Edmonton, but there wasn’t one in Dallas or Houston in 2005 either. Much more than the housing boom in the US, the Canadian boom has been ignited by our central bank, which has lowered the overnight rate twice on Poloz’s watch.",

Under an income tax, politicians can buy votes by promising government benefits to those who vote for him that the other guy has to pay for. The federal income tax system is a redistribution of wealth from people who have earned it to people who have not earned it. This takes place in the form of government programs, subsidies & grants. A tax system that invades financial privacy, confiscates private property & can put people in jail does not belong in a free society. Our Founding Fathers did not believe in a direct tax on individuals. Marx & Engels adopted the income tax in their “Communist Manifesto”.\nhttps://nccs.net/1996-03-answers-to-americas-tax-problems",

It went out for bids a few days ago. \n\n(3) A 9-mile, one-lane gravel road to Sitka's Katlian Bay for $15 million.

The question belies the fact that many professed followers of God are not connected with Him. People don't like having to admit their distance from God and one of the common responses is claiming that God reveals things to them when He has not. God communicates with those who are willing to listen and obey, not those who claim to be His followers but do not obey. So one of the surest ways I've found to test such a claim is to see what change it makes in a person. Next is seeing if they are ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit as God instructed. If the power of God is not obviously making changes in their life or guiding their ministry, the \"voice in their head\" is most likely their own.",

Maybe Pashtunistan, but I suspect most of the victims of Muslim Trads are simply killed rather than being given the opportunity to express faith in Allah, since Allah is Arabic for Elohim, which is Hebrew for God. Technically, saying there is no God but Allah is not apostacy because it is the same word. DH, by the way, gets us out of that mindset which has wars over religion or doctrine. That  is not piety, it is sacralidge. DH is the final step in denouncing the past sacrliedges of the Inquisition, the 100 years war, the Crusades and the blood shed in the 4th Century over heresy.",

If there are any remaining racists in the Democratic Party, the members will marginalize and push them out.\n\nThe Democratic Party of the 1800s, though, was the conservative party.

So yeah, Gentiles, while benefiting from the Jewish ‘rejection’ of Christianity (and why wouldn’t they reject Paul’s remake of Pagan motifs?), had no part in the Jewish heritage which yielded 12 apostolic judges on thrones to judge Israel. Israel would not/ will not be judged by Gentiles. So Paul was not making Jesus ordain priests (Paul knew nothing of Christian priests as there were none then or he did not accept them as such??); rather, Paul and Gospel author(s) were intent on making Jesus into the divine and legitimate heir of a Jewish tradition of kings, covenants, judges, that was at least in popular imagination already 1,000 years old",

The boy let go of the leash and the dog ran away from him, why did the boy let go of the leash, he's old enough to know better. And the boy was never there. He was walking schooby on the trail behind the trees near boniface across the street from the shell gas station. I was on the phone with animal control by the time the boy even found the dog. The first vehicle he saw was a black truck which isn't the color of my truck. When APD contacted me I asked the officer over and over to please tell the family I am very sorry and feel like crap about it cause an innocent animal was just killed, but it was an unavoidable accident. Another thing too is most people like me, don't know what to do when that happens and just keep goin but I want to make sure the proper people knew so the dog would be picked up.",

The entire unit is a comedy of errors. And maybe the coach just isn't coaching them well enough or maybe everyone is just trying to do too much because of our struggles and end up making shit worse. No one is saying siemian is the future, he has clearly regressed but if u think those coaches are just willfully tieing themselves to a losing horse ... U are wrong.

During that period of time her hip became infected, my father being an MD intervened to no avail, my great aunt passed away at 63 from what at the time was highly a treatable condition. But she was afterall 63, had she been 33 she would have been treated and could very well be alive today.

Your idea of \"engagement\" for Democrats to entertain the repeal of Obamacare regardless of objection or issue to policy or process?\nThe Democrats are just supposed to ignore the compromises already included, such as the compromise from the initial hope for a universal or a single payer system for a universal insurance plan created by a conservative think tank.\nNor would they have a valid objection to the closed door secret no public/committee process straight to the Senate floor approach McConnell is pushing?  Or that Obama often tried to meet Republicans half-way (even going to a Republican retreat to answer questions) and engage them in the process that Trump has yet to even loosely resemble?  And no, threatening Republicans with \"I'll go to the Democrats\" isn't engaging Democrats.",

No one could possibly be that ignorant, or that misguided, or that cruel. Or that lost. I choose to believe that your post is ingeniously ironic... and tragically sad",

The Children's edition has color pictures many churches especially Catholic Churches have life size replicas of naked bloody Jesus hammered to a cross. \nGod did not forgive or forget. He killed men, woman & children. He killed anyone who crossed him. He killed to make a point.\nI was raised in a Christain home, grew up in church. Now I refuse to go to church.

The swing state phenomena comes about not because of the electoral system per se, but because states currently award all electoral votes of the state to the candidate getting a simple majority of the popular vote.  If they awarded electors proportionately, the swing state phenomenon would also disappear.  Effectively, going to the popular vote is not necessary to eliminate the swing vote phenomenon.",

The woman is a legal person with all that implies. She has a right to privacy and bodily integrity. Is a zygote a person in the legal sense? No. Nor is a fetus or an embryo. In Roe v Wade, the Court decided that the state has an \"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life\" from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are more compelling than that of the state.

They should not be reelected. But it is unclear that either opposition party would be better. In fact, that is the reason Wynne is Premier now! Not because she was viewed so positively on her own, but because the opposition, in particular the Hudak led PC's, were correctly judged unfit. The NDP remains the same, Brown is probably better than Hudak, but it isn't clear he is much better. Still, the disaster that is Wynne after 13 years of Liberal rule may be enough for the electorate to vote in a different potential disaster in waiting, the Brown PC's, in place of a certain disaster in Wynne.

Canada's politicians mistake money from anywhere as 'good', no matter how it is earned & how it is (mis)used.

Construction will not start until the Court process is completed, and that will take years.

With this ruling in place, cities have the ability to place longer term moratoriums in place while researching the affects on human safety.

Given the state of a lot of Canada's rail tracks and the frequency of derailments and the fact that dangerously unstable crude was allowed to be hauled on trains with a single operator over MM&A's loucy tracks and parked overnight on a mainline at the top of a grade is ludicrous!

As with all the others who tried to do this, he learned that the people wanted a change to new faces, voices and promises, a shiny new pony.  \n\nTrudeau in the final 2 weeks of the campaign became that shiny pony and won with a slightly smaller vote % than Harper in 2011.

Look no farther then a couple of years ago when the returns on one river were so low the state fish and game had to close the river to fishing . Alaska natives said to heck with everyone and fished anyways. The river would have been gutted had the state not stopped them and taken their boats.

It was the economic situation that fell out.” Actually, the current backcast for the 2016-17 deficit is $23B, but Trudeau is probably too clueless to know this.

In six short weeks they could teach you to bus tables, operate a debit machine and, for us old folks, make correct change. \n\nA third, more vicious response could be to impose a service charge or higher prices in lieu of tipping wait staff directly.

A relative of mine, Louis Pichette, trapped the region for Hudson's Bay Co. He was the first Euro-American in Northeast CA (1820). \n\nThe Paiutes were considered to be more primitive than many other tribes in the Oregon Territory. This was because of their transitory camps and desire to avoid contact. Resources were scarce with little surplus. They rarely traded but raiding was an honored practice. \n\nWhat ties the op-ed and its comments together is the different rate of exploitation practiced by natives and Euro-Americans. The trappers were a bridge. Over-harvesting the regions fur bearers infuriated the Paiutes. \n\nA Marxist interpretation adds to this thesis. Capitalism ramps up the rate of resource  extraction and often leads to systemic degradation. This is the Euro-American legacy.  The opinions here reflect different views on its value.",

I wept when sadness or anger overflowed in what I perceived was frustration for what he couldn't do as others could.  He was different.

It is up to the people to decide what collective benefits we want not government, unions and industry.",

I have no idea of your employment and it's none of my business.  I sympathize with your loss of retirement/pension benefits when the company was sold.  That's an issue with your employer, not with Oregon's public employees.  Over the years I've frequently responded to critics of PERS by suggesting the creation of a PRIVATE EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM created to mirror PERS.  This would have created a \"safe\" retirement system to protect folks just like you.  My main point: instead of tearing down others, how about working to \"lift up\" folks.  Gary Crum",

When Comey did not stop the investigation, he fired Comey. He initially cited an FBI Memo recommending firing Comey, but Trump said he made up his mind to fire before the memo, C. From his discussions with Comey then his firing Comey, it looks like Trump fired Comey to stop or hinder the Flynn investigation. Trump was confusing about his reasons for firing Comey: 1. He said the FBI memo was why he fired Comey, and 2. He specifically said the memo was not a part of his decision to fire Comey. The FBI memo said Comey over-pursued Clinton and bad-mouthed her after the investigation ended. Trump would never say that. So it looks like he tried to hinder the investigation.",

Then I found Lisa’s diabetes story (google \" HOW EVER I FREED MYSELF FROM THE DIABETES \" ) I read that article from end to end because everything the writer was saying made absolute sense.

And that just goes hand in hand with how they treated my friend who was denied a change of flight for his return due to unforeseen complications with his surgery.

The speed limit is the maximum speed at which vehicles should be travelling, i.e. 100 KPH. So, if someone else is at 130 KPH the speed limit is still 100 not 130. This also applies to HOV lanes. The Minister of Transport also stated this under questioning in the Legislative Assembly. The law needs to be changed and  then maybe we'll have a little less road rage.

Six Offensive linemen, Double TE, Two RB's and a quarterback and run the ball 50 times with your 4 RB's.\n\nJoesph can only play what Elway gives him.  Its not like McCoy or Musgrave are failing because they can't coach.  They can only coach what they are given.  The only thing I can think is that Elway is hoarding his money to sign some FA's due for a payday.  Roby, Ray etc.  Because it was clear he was willing to spend 15 million a year on a DL but not any kind of money on bringing in a couple of tackles that might have helped.\n\nElway is in a pickle.  He needs his draft picks which are cheap cap players so he can pay his defense.  As a result he is unwilling to do what the Texans did or the Chiefs did and move up got a QB.",

The king wanted to keep the Catherine's dowry (over a million in today's currency, which would have had to be repaid out of the Privy Purse).

Is that overt act of racism, eh? Police work is a difficult job and often, people who may not be qualified mentally may still wear the uniform. Most of these shooting take place because the officers claims that they \"fear for his/her life\" despite of the fact that there may not be any visible threat. Fear of a threat, is not good enough to kill. There got to be a clear threat. In all three shooting, it was the fear that triggered the shots. This does make you wonder if some of the police officers are too fearful of a personality to do their job? After all, most Marines will run toward the fire, but the few will go the opposite way.",

Using your logic (that's fine in this case), since Flynn was held accountable (forced to resign his power position) he was guilty of \"a clear violation of a law or rule.\"  Since that was the case, do you feel Trump was \"wrong\" in hiding Flynn's \"clear violation of a law or rule\" until it was exposed by the media and he could no longer hide it?  I'd be interested in your answer.   Gary Crum",

Just look at what happened to Gaza and the last settlers left, it turned into a terrorist haven for pig-headed Islamist terrorists and  a base to launch terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. When you have a political leadership that rewards the families of terrorists who stab pregnant women at the grocery store, don't be surprised by the skepticism from the Israelis.
