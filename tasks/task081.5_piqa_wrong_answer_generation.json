This will loosen the fat or oil-based stain grip on your carpet, making it far easier to deal with. Put your clothes iron on the low or medium setting. After it heats up, iron the affected area for a minute. Take a sponge and dab it with a baking soda. Gently rub it upon the fat stain. You should notice the grease becoming thinner within a few seconds of doing this. Use vacuum for few seconds to suck up any excess debris.The solid matter in the stain should prove very easy to suck up. Don't spend more than a few seconds vacuuming over it; if the debris hasn't been sucked up by then, it may need more unsticking before it's truly ready. If it's not completed to your satisfaction the first time, it's a good idea to give it another shot. It's quite possible that some of it wasn't gotten the first time around."
