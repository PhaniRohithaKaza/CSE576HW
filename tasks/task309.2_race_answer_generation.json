            "input": "Article: Taking a shower is relaxing. You can hum a song, daydream or think about nothing, leaving the real world behind you. But did you know that showering can also benefit your mind?\nA research by Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist from Yale University in the US interviewed over 3,000 people around the world. It turned out that nearly two-thirds of the interviewees said they had experienced new ideas in the shower and were more likely to have them in the shower than at work.\nSo why does a simple shower have such magic power? Science can explain it.\nShowering can help to raise our level of dopamine, a hormone   closely related to our creativity. \"People vary in terms of their level of creativity according to the activity of dopamine\", explained Alice Flaherty, a famous American neuroscientist. \"Taking a warm shower can make us feel relaxed and therefore make the dopamine level rise and bring 'Aha!' moment to us.\"\nBesides the chemical changes, showering may give you a break from what you feel you have been stuck with. Especially when you have thought hard all day about a problem, jumping into the shower can keep you from the outside world so that you can focus on your inner feelings and memories. In this way, according to American psychologist Shelley H. Carson, author ofYour Creative Brain, \"a showering hour may turn into an 'incubation   period' for your ideas.\"\nCompared with sitting in front of a computer, taking a shower is something we do less frequently in our daily life. When showering, we get a fresh experience with the change of location, temperature and humidity. \"New and unexpected experiences can lead to positive changes in thinking,\" explained Kaufman. \"Getting off the couch and jumping in the shower may create a distance and force you to think from a new point of view.\"\nShowering allows us to enjoy the creative juices of our minds, but it needn't just be the bathroom where you get your inspiration. For instance, Gertrude Stein, a female American writer and poet, got new ideas by driving around a farm and stopping at different cows until she found the one that most inspired her. So try to create your own way to free your mind, whether it's a walk near the ocean, a country drive or reading a book at home. \n Question: It can be inferred from the article that   _  . \n Options: (A) changes in the frequency of an action can create a new perspective (B)  it is a good idea to talk with others about their sources of inspiration (C)  our lives might feel longer and fuller if we frequently try new things (D)  it is helpful to try something different rather than stay focused on a difficult task",

Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to increase the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 33 percent it is today to more than 50 percent by 2015. Within the city, 55 percent of all commuters already travel by bike.\nAlready Copenhagen stands out among other European capitals for its cycling infrastructure, counting more than 390 kilometers of bike paths. \n Question: What is the main idea of the passage? \n Options: (A) Copenhagen is planning to build bicycle-friendly highways.

Scientists have shown a new threat from this lifestyle that they call  \"muscular inactivity  \".\nSitting still for long periods of time leads to the buildup of substances   in the blood that are harmful to health. And exercise alone won't drive them away.\nMillions of people spend their days between car,office desk and the sofa in front of the TV. While the bad influences are well rocognized,it has been thought that they can be changed by regular trips to the gym or swimming pool.\nNow researchers say that is not enough. In addition to regular exercise,office workers need to keep moving while they work,by making regular trips to the printer,coffee machine or to chat with workmates.\nElin EkblomBak,an expert on health,says research shows long periods of sitting and lack    of \"whole body muscular movement\"  are strongly linked to obesity,heart disease and cancer,and a higher risk of death,regardless of   whether they take enough exercise.\n\"Everyone knows about the health benefits of regular exercise. But what we haven't realized before is that longperiod sitting down carries an extra risk that cannot be dealt with by taking exercise,\" Dr EkblomBak said,adding that sitting still should be recognized as a risk to health.\n\"It is important to have a fiveminute break from desk work every 45 minutes. Don't email workmates--walk across the office to give them the message. Take a coffee break or put the printer in the next room. I am a desk worker and I try to do it. It is not difficult but sometimes you get lost in your work and you forget about it.\"\nHowever,more studies are needed to confirm the ill effects of sitting for too long and ways of fighting them.

Many people dislike its bitter and astringent  flavor when they take a sip.\n\"It felt like drinking Chinese herbal medicine. I never expected that I would gradually accept it afterwards, and even become addicted to it,\" said a traveler surnamed Zhang who comes from Shijiazhuang in northern China's Hebei province.\nLangshan village is said to be the birthplace of Gongcheng \"oil tea\" whose ideal ingredients are green tea and fermented tea. The village has preserved well its buildings and roads dating back to late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), as well as its traditional way of making the special tea.\nLin Fengyou, 60, introduced the cooking process. She looks younger than her age, and attributes this to the benefits of drinking \"oil tea\" throughout the year.\nThe first procedure is to use a wooden hammer to pound the tea while heating it in an iron pot, and then add edible oil and boiled water afterwards. She filters off the solid residues , and pours the glue-like green tea soup into bowls. Then, she adds salt, caraway seed, green onion, dried rice, fried groundnuts, sliced taro and fried beans.\nThe taste of the \"oil tea\" is a mixture of the distinctive flavors of all its ingredients. Local people usually eat it together with glutinous rice  balls, rice dumplings and glutinous rice cake.\nThe villagers consume \"oil tea\" three times a day.

By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.\nAbout one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west.

Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language. \n Question: The purpose of Frederick's experiment was to    _   . \n Options: (A) prove that children are born with the ability to speak (B)  discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech (C)  find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak (D)  prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language",

I couldn't help but be reminded of Syona's teacher and how she supports each kid in a very similar way. Ulmer recently shared a video of his teaching experience. \"I have seen their confidence and self-worth increase rapidly, \" he said. All I could think was: How lucky these students are to have such inspirational teachers.\nSyona's teacher has an attitude that can best be summarized in one word: awesome. Her teacher doesn't focus on what can't be done--she focuses on what can be done. Over the past several months, my husband Dilip and I have seen Syona's confidence increase tenfold.

Today many young people stay inside watching television, playing computer games, or surfing the Internet. Rarely can people see children today, enjoying themselves outdoors, on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods.\n   Young people who join in after-school sports activities will be out of the house. They will be on the move, running and jumping, which is great exercise. They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player, whey they are part of an organized sport. They also learn about good sportsmanship, teamwork and gaining confidence. There are even sports that young athletes do better in school. Outdoor sports give children, teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine, which improve their over-all health. They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun, and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity  . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing.\n   Children do better in sports events, when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity. While track and field events may not be some small children's cup of tea, there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards. The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time. The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each, for a total of 6. Eight-year-old Jerel Rhodes II, won gold medals for the shot put  , and the discus   throw. Seven-year-old Jadyn Rhodes, received a silver medal fro the shot put, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter race. Five-year-old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800-meter race, as well as the discuss throw.\n   There is a down side to athletic activities. Not everyone will go home as a winner. If your child does not win a medal, you should not complain about him or her. You should be proud of him or her just for taking part. If a child feels bad about his or her performance, he or she may be teased by other children, or his or her parents may express disappointment. All these can have an effect on self-esteem. The bottom line is to get your children out of the house, and to be involved in activities that keep them moving. Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all. If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making, encourage --but do not push -- him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports.\nThe Mayo Clinic, an internationally famous medical research group, says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports. Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable, or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them. If you encourage those like the Rhodes family, who have the desire to play sports, they just might bring home a gold, silver or bronze medal. \n Question: In the author's opinion today's children   _  . \n Options: (A) frequently play on the playground (B)  stay up watching TV or surfing the Internet (C)  often take part in outdoor sports and games (D)  are rarely seen enjoying themselves outdoors",

So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself. Do not move about or kick up dust. \n Question: To reduce the injury from the earthquake, items made of glass should be put   _  . \n Options: (A) on cupboards (B)  in the bedroom (C)  on a lower surface (D)  \"where children cant reach them\"",

Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.\nThe team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren't feeling sad.\n\"We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\" Thorstenson said in a statement. \"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way.\"\nThorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.\nThe team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn't do that in a specific order.

Traditionally, spas were places with a natural spring producing warm waters that could be used in hydrotherapy   treatments. They were places where you \"took the waters\" --- meaning you drank some of the water or bathed in it.\nBut nowadays, a \"spa\" can mean a variety of things. In general, the term is often used to refer to commercial establishment that provides many services for health, fitness, weight loss, beauty and relaxation. This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town. It was popular with the inventor Thomas Edison, the writer Johann Goethe, and many famous people and European emperors.\nToday, although taking the waters isn't as common as it used to be, spa treatments are more popular than ever. \n Question: What can we learn from the passage? \n Options: (A) The former name of Larlovy Vary was Carlsbad. (B)  Spa treatments are not so popular as before. (C)  Chopin visited Marienbad frequently. (D)  Marienbad is located in the UK.",

Some large breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds and Huskies can tolerate the colder weather better than others. These dogs may also develop a thicker coat over time as they are exposed to colder weather.\n Smaller breeds, however, like Chihuahuas and Miniature Pinschers, breeds with short coats and puppies should wear some type of protection, i.e, a coat or sweater, if the temperature drops too low. Look for coats or sweaters with high collars or a turtleneck that covers your dog from the base of the tail on top to the belly underneath.\n Dog booties   provide good protection from chemicals or salts on the pavement as well as mud. If you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside.\n Other tips\nWhen you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. It is especially important to keep your dog well groomed   during the winter months to protect him from the elements.\n If your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. Dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced.\n The amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age.

One hundred years later, however, the Indians only had a very small part of the land that originally belonged to them. How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died. Between 1843 and 1854 the Indian population in one area of the country went down from 100,000 to 30,000.\nMore land was needed for the increasing number of white settlers. In Washington, the old respect for the rights of the Indians disappeared. The old promises to the Indians were broken; the government began to move groups of Indians from their original homelands to other poorer parts of the country. Some Indians reacted angrily and violently to this treatment. They began to attack white settlers, and the Indian war began. For 30 years, until the late 1880s, different groups of Indians fought against the injustices of the white man. They had a few famous successes, but the result of the struggle was never in doubt. There were too many white soldiers, and they were too powerful. Many Indians were killed; the survivors were moved from their homelands to different areas of the country. It was a terrible chapter in the history of a country that promised freedom and equality to everyone. \n Question: It is implied in the passage that   _  . \n Options: (A) the Indians had many great successes in the Indians wars (B)  the Indians had no doubt that they would win the wars (C)  after the war the Indians stayed where they were before (D)  the Indians were too weak to win the struggle",

We have instant satisfaction, fast food, speed reading, mobile phones; even the stress management books have titles like \"Stress Management in 60 Seconds\".\nCanadian Classics Professor Margaret Visser points out that the perception that we have \"no time\" is one of the most strict concepts of Western culture. Visser says that \"no time\" is used as an excuse and also as a spur ; it both stimulates us and forces us, just as a concept such as 'honour' did for the ancient Greeks. According to Visser, the feeling that Westerners have \"no time\" is abstract, quantitative, amoral , unarguable, bringing pressure on each person as an individual. At the same time, the \"no time\" excuse escapes\nby claiming to be a condition created entirely out of our good fortune.\nLife offers \"so many pleasures, so many choices\".\nThe fact that women now work outside the home has contributed to the \"no time\" trend. But more important, Visser says, is the fact that feeling rushed has become an important component  of our economy. Marketing of \"time-saving\" products causes people to buy more and work longer. So we eat out or buy prepared food to save time. The fax-it-to-my-car technology only contributes to the constant hurry. In our rushed and exhausted state, even the obligation  to sit down to casual meal with family seems like a pressure. In comparison with the decision to act on a sudden whimz   to consume a microwave mug of soup, the act of eating together and not getting up from the table until everyone else has finished seems an incredibly time-consuming event. Being in one's own personal hurry in the West is somehow \"free and preferable\" \n Question: Which of the following doesn't contribute to feeling rushed? \n Options: (A) Marketing of time-saving products. (B)  The fax-it-to-me-car technology. (C)  Eating together and not getting up until everybody has finished (D)  Longer working hours.",

I would have liked to leave a legacy   of words explaining what it has meant to have twins. One reason that there is not a great deal written about being a mother of a new baby is that there is seldom a moment to think of anything else but the baby's needs.\nWith twins, I did not have a spare hand to write with.\nBefore my twins were born, my days were long and I had nothing to write about. After the twins' birth I did have something to write about, but I found myself facing not a pen and paper but milk bottles.\nSome nights, friends would visit. They would leave at 11 p.m., heading for bed, and for us the night was only just beginning. With twins, there is really no night. Each feeding lasts a long time.

There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh. People surf the Internet in Welsh, keep up with friends on Facebook and write blogs in Welsh.\nBy the way,\"Croeso I Gymru!\" means \"Welcome to Wales!\"  I hope you'll be able to visit it one day. \n Question: According to the passage, Welsh   _  . \n Options: (A) has developed from Cornish (B)  is still widely used in the UK (C)  sounds a little similar to English (D)  is more widely spoken than before",

In addition to that, roads, parking lots, and yet more buildings are being constructed. The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven. But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden?\nWhether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or meadow grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs. If used more widely, green roofs could decrease a city's total energy costs, reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage   systems, and actually extend the life time of the roof itself. And green roofs do something else: They beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th.

So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you.

This is a common problem for millions of children around the world. Many families use kerosene oil   lamps. There are many problems with these lamps. They produce only a small amount of light. They are dangerous to breathe. And they are a big fire danger, causing many injuries and deaths each year. Kerosene costs less than other forms of lighting, but it is still costly in poor countries. Professor Irvine says many people spend over 100 dollars a year on the fuel.\nWhen he returned to Canada, he began researching ways to provide safe and clean lighting. He began experimenting with light-emitting diodes  , LEDs, at his lab. As a professor of renewable energy, he already knew about the technology. Light-emitting diodes are small glass lamps that use much less electricity than traditional bulbs   and last much longer. He used a one-watt bright white LED made in Japan. He found it on the Internet and connected it to a bicycle-powered generator  . He remembers thinking it was so bright that a child could read by the light of a single diode.\nIn 2000, after much research and many experiments, he returned to Nepal to put the systems into homes. Now the homes of 25,000 people in 51 countries have been equipped with it. \"The one-time cost of our system which basically lives forever, as well as the solar panel -- is less than one hundred dollars. So, one year of kerosene would pay for a solid-state lighting system,\" he said. Now his aim is to develop a lower-cost lighting system. In January, Irvine is leaving the University of Calgary.

Now let's compare Eastern and Western weddings.\nChinese and Indian brides normally wear red dresses and most of the wedding decorations are of the same color. This is because the color red is said to bring good fortune. In many Eastern weddings, especially Chinese weddings, the bride will change into a different dress after the ceremony. White dresses only arrived in modern times because of the influence of Western wedding dress designs.\nWestern wedding dresses are different. Brides usually wear a wedding dress that is white in color and wear it throughout the whole wedding. Wearing white wedding dresses is said to have started in the 1840s, beginning with Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain. There are occasions when brides dress into more comfortable clothing so that they will be able to move more freely during the wedding reception.\nTraditional practices are strictly followed for most Western weddings. The couple follow up with any plans they have agreed and decided on to make their special wedding day unique and memorable. Wedding receptions and other celebrations differ among the East and the West, but the concept is still the same. They are held to show gratitude towards family members, friends and guests for being a part of the wedding ceremony.\nAnother common custom that weddings of the East and the West have is the wearing of the wedding veil . According to superstitious  beliefs, the bride wears a veil to protect her from being seen by evil spirits and the bridesmaids are decoys .

The number of attacks is very small.\nHow does a shark hunt? Muscles and fins  give the shark its speed and maneuverability in the water. A shark's front fins act like the wings of a plane and let it \"fly\" through the water. The tail acts like a high-power propeller .\nBut the big thing that gives the shark its edge in the ocean is its sensory package. The package includes the shark' eyes ,ears ,skin, nose and mouth, as well as electric sensing.\nA shark' nose is probably its most important sense.  If you were to put a single drop of blood in a swimming pool ,a great white shark could smell that. And they can tell the direction that the smell is coming from.\nSharks handle their electric sensing using cell located in the head .Whenever something moves using its muscles , a shark can detect the electrical impulses flowing to those muscles. A shark can electrically \"see\" anything that has muscles even if it is hiding or the water is not clear.\nSharks even have vibration sensors in their skin. Even something moves near  the shark ,tubes pick up the pressure changes and hairs inside the tubes send signals to the brain . This extra sense allows a shark to turn quickly and attack again.\nWhen you put all these different senses together ,it makes the shark a nearly ideal hunter. A shark can detect prey from miles away and then use eyes ,electrosensing and movement sensing to home in .\nStrangely, sharks do not seem to use these senses to\npeople. The very low number of sharks tells us that sharks do not hunt people on a regular basis. On the other hand , people love to hunt sharks. Millions of sharks die every year. Without protection ,extinction is a definite possibility. \n Question: In this text ,the writer implies that    _   . \n Options: (A) there are many shark attacks.

Along with making sure you are appropriately dressed, your dog should also be properly protected from the elements. Some large breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds and Huskies can tolerate the colder weather better than others. These dogs may also develop a thicker coat over time as they are exposed to colder weather.\n Smaller breeds, however, like Chihuahuas and Miniature Pinschers, breeds with short coats and puppies should wear some type of protection, i.e, a coat or sweater, if the temperature drops too low. Look for coats or sweaters with high collars or a turtleneck that covers your dog from the base of the tail on top to the belly underneath.\n Dog booties   provide good protection from chemicals or salts on the pavement as well as mud. If you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside.\n Other tips\nWhen you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. It is especially important to keep your dog well groomed   during the winter months to protect him from the elements.\n If your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. Dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced.\n The amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age. Remember that ill or elderly dogs are more sensitive to cold weather. Dogs whom cold weather agrees with can spend hours outside without getting cold but some of the smaller and younger dogs' exercise sessions should be kept shorter. Dogs should not be left outside unattended.\n Another activity to consider is doggie daycare, which is an excellent alternative during cold weather months.

Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\" \n Question: Why does the author refer to chimpanzees and dogs? \n Options: (A) To suggest that they are much better at interpreting gaze alternation.

Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to increase the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 33 percent it is today to more than 50 percent by 2015. Within the city, 55 percent of all commuters already travel by bike.\nAlready Copenhagen stands out among other European capitals for its cycling infrastructure, counting more than 390 kilometers of bike paths. \n Question: What does Lea Bresell think of the present bike traffic on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare? \n Options: (A) It is crowded and unpleasant (B)  Going forward is extremely easy.

But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\"\n--Albert Einstein\nIf you have a kid with special needs in the school system, chances are you have come across that saying hanging on a classroom wall. My five-year-old daughter Syona has cerebral palsy (a medical condition affecting someone's control over their movement ) and it means, combined with her communication challenges and sight problems, that standard assessments (and by \"standard\", I mean the ones used to assess kids with special needs ) aren't always an accurate measure of her abilities.\nBy now you have probably heard about Chris Ulmer, the 26-year-old teacher in Jacksonville, Florida, who starts his special education class by calling up each student individually to give them much admiration and a high-five (a gesture of greeting or congratulation). I couldn't help but be reminded of Syona's teacher and how she supports each kid in a very similar way. Ulmer recently shared a video of his teaching experience. \"I have seen their confidence and self-worth increase rapidly, \" he said. All I could think was: How lucky these students are to have such inspirational teachers.\nSyona's teacher has an attitude that can best be summarized in one word: awesome. Her teacher doesn't focus on what can't be done--she focuses on what can be done. Over the past several months, my husband Dilip and I have seen Syona's confidence increase tenfold. She uses words she wouldn't have thought of using before. She recently told me about her classmate's trip to Ecuador and was very proud when I understood her on the first try.\nI actually wonder what the influence would be if we did something similar to what Ulmer does with his students in our home. We've recently started our day by reminding each other of the good qualities we all possess. If we are reminded of our strengths on a regular basis, we will become increasingly confident about progress and success.\nUlmer's reach as a teacher goes far beyond the walls of his classroom. In fact, he teaches all of us to take a moment and truly appreciate the strengths of an important person in our lives. \n Question: What does the author think of Einstein's quote? \n Options: (A) Funny.

In the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in war  . By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.\nAbout one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west. Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. The greenhorn didn't have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country.\nSomeone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb.

You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.\nThe Green Revolution   is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains.

Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know. Presumably human beings have various capacities for thinking situations which are likewise independent of language. \n Question: According to the theory of \"thought\" devised by J. B. Watson, thinking is  _  . \n Options: (A) talking to the soul (B)  concealed speech (C)  speaking nonverbally (D)  a non-linguistic behavior",

Traditionally, spas were places with a natural spring producing warm waters that could be used in hydrotherapy   treatments. They were places where you \"took the waters\" --- meaning you drank some of the water or bathed in it.\nBut nowadays, a \"spa\" can mean a variety of things. In general, the term is often used to refer to commercial establishment that provides many services for health, fitness, weight loss, beauty and relaxation. This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town. It was popular with the inventor Thomas Edison, the writer Johann Goethe, and many famous people and European emperors.\nToday, although taking the waters isn't as common as it used to be, spa treatments are more popular than ever. \n Question: From Paragraph 4, we can infer that    _   . \n Options: (A) spas have a history of about 200 years (B)  Japan has more spas than any other countries (C)  the Romans played a positive part in the popularity of spas (D)  ordinary people could enjoy thermal baths in 18",

As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine. \n It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  \nWe have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  \nA recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog?\n Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.  \n What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  \nWe prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings. \n Question: What does the author mainly argue for? \n Options: (A) Pets are of great significance to us human beings. (B)  We should rethink about our attitude towards animals and mankind. (C)  It is kind of human beings to extend kindness to animals.

Scientists have shown a new threat from this lifestyle that they call  \"muscular inactivity  \".\nSitting still for long periods of time leads to the buildup of substances   in the blood that are harmful to health. And exercise alone won't drive them away.\nMillions of people spend their days between car,office desk and the sofa in front of the TV. While the bad influences are well rocognized,it has been thought that they can be changed by regular trips to the gym or swimming pool.\nNow researchers say that is not enough. In addition to regular exercise,office workers need to keep moving while they work,by making regular trips to the printer,coffee machine or to chat with workmates.\nElin EkblomBak,an expert on health,says research shows long periods of sitting and lack    of \"whole body muscular movement\"  are strongly linked to obesity,heart disease and cancer,and a higher risk of death,regardless of   whether they take enough exercise.\n\"Everyone knows about the health benefits of regular exercise. But what we haven't realized before is that longperiod sitting down carries an extra risk that cannot be dealt with by taking exercise,\" Dr EkblomBak said,adding that sitting still should be recognized as a risk to health.\n\"It is important to have a fiveminute break from desk work every 45 minutes. Don't email workmates--walk across the office to give them the message. Take a coffee break or put the printer in the next room. I am a desk worker and I try to do it. It is not difficult but sometimes you get lost in your work and you forget about it.\"\nHowever,more studies are needed to confirm the ill effects of sitting for too long and ways of fighting them.

It comes as world leaders are talking about fighting global warming in Copenhagen, Denmark. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are the main cause of global warming, which leads to extreme weather and other conditions.\nLiving a low carbon life means trying to cut carbon dioxide emissions  in one's daily life.

In 2009, some young people died as a result of the extreme methods, which led to a nationwide discussion. In November, the Ministry of Health banned the use of physical punishment to keep children off the net and dropped the term \"net addiction \".

You forget about dairy and head for the bakery   section. Guess what? You just walked into an odor   trap  ! The odor was cooked up by scientists in a lab.\nFor years, scientists have been studying the special powers of smell. They found that more than our other senses, smell changes our mood and helps us remember things.\nSo companies have begun spending thousands of dollars to scent   entire stores. Artificial   scents are being used to lead customers by the nose. These smells help to get people inside and put them in the mood to buy. They even make customers remember the store later, so they'll come back for more. Also, many companies have smartly made use of product smells. A company added lemon fragrance to its dish cleaner. They wanted people to think the soap contained \"natural\" cleaners. It worked!\nNew uses for smells are being created every day. One bank, for example, gives customers coupons   advertising car loans  . To get people to take out a loan, bank officials hope to coat these coupons with the fresh leather smell of a new car. In Australia, telephone offices are putting sweat odor on unpaid bills. Since some people sweat when they're scared, this smell might remind them of when they were frightened. And they'll pay the bills right away!\nWhat lies ahead for our noses? Smell scientists are working on some pretty far-out ideas. Would you believe TV sets that produce smells? Or how about scent diets? Certain food smells will fool your stomach into thinking it's full. Alarm clocks will scent your bedroom with a strong pleasant smell designed to wake you up. Scientists are even working on ways to keep garbage from smelling. Researchers expect scents to help students make more sense of what they're learning.\nAnd just think. \n Question: What does the author mean by saying \"Someday soon, even your homework may smell nice!\"? \n Options: (A) Students would benefit more from smell research. (B)  Students would be more willing to do homework. (C)  Smell research would develop beyond our imagination. (D)  Smell research would make great differences to our life.",

Albert Einstein was unable to get a job as a physics professor. He could have said to himself, \"Well, I just don't have the work relative to physics. I should give up on it and settle for something else.\" Instead, he wrote the two most famous papers when he was employed as a patent  clerk. After their publication, there was not a major university in the world that would not have been glad to have him on their staff.\nIf you want to work as an artist and you are making a living as a waiter, don't think of yourself as a waiter who hopes one day to become an artist. That puts the work you love somewhere off in the distant future. Rather, think of yourself as an artist, supporting yourself by waiter tables--and paint, or draw as much as you can. It is possible to earn a living wage as a waiter working 24 hours a week. That leaves plenty of time to devote to training or developing your craft in the off hours.\nWhile seeking the work you love, it helps to expand your awareness  into the universe of all possibilities. You don't want to be limited to the ideas of what you should do or what you have done before. Having opened to all possibilities, you can make a final decision and select the work you love as your own.\nDoing the work you love requires that you be equally comfortable with the imaginative and the practical.

Traditionally, spas were places with a natural spring producing warm waters that could be used in hydrotherapy   treatments. They were places where you \"took the waters\" --- meaning you drank some of the water or bathed in it.\nBut nowadays, a \"spa\" can mean a variety of things. In general, the term is often used to refer to commercial establishment that provides many services for health, fitness, weight loss, beauty and relaxation. This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town. It was popular with the inventor Thomas Edison, the writer Johann Goethe, and many famous people and European emperors.\nToday, although taking the waters isn't as common as it used to be, spa treatments are more popular than ever. \n Question: What can we learn about a spa? \n Options: (A) It makes profits mainly on facials. (B)  It is a center for rich people to relax. (C)  It provides more services than before. (D)  It is where one can get medical treatment.",

Many studies of automobile accidents have shown that safety belts can save lives. One study showed that forty percent of those killed in auto accidents could have been saved if they had been wearing seat belts.\nUnfortunately, belts are worn only by a small percentage of drivers and passengers -- about fifteen percent in cities, and only nine percent in small towns. And safety belts cannot protect people who do not wear them.\nIn order to find out what kinds of people do wear seat belts, a study was made in several cities of the United States. The following facts were about those who use their safety belts:\n1. They do not smoke while driving.\n2. They have had more education than non-users.\n3. They know someone who was injured (but not killed) in an automobile accident.\nAdvertisements based on these facts have been printed in newspapers and magazines in order to teach people the importance of using seat belts. But these advertisements have not helped much. Some people believe there should be a law requiring drivers and passengers to use safety belts. In Australia, where there is such a law, deaths in auto accidents have decreased twenty-four percent. \n Question: People who live in small towns    _   . \n Options: (A) have fewer accidents than those who live in cities (B)  are less likely to use seat belts than those who live in cities (C)  welcome the passing of a law to require the use of seat belts (D)  are against the law that requires people to use seat belts",

In addition to that, roads, parking lots, and yet more buildings are being constructed. The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven. But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden?\nWhether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or meadow grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs. If used more widely, green roofs could decrease a city's total energy costs, reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage   systems, and actually extend the life time of the roof itself. And green roofs do something else: They beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th. Now that's a great achievement.\nThe environmental nonprofit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs progamme.

Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money.

            "input": "Article: It is evident that there is a close connection between the capacity to use language and the capacities covered by the verb \"to think\". Indeed, some writers have identified thinking with using words: Plato coined the saying, \"In thinking the soul is talking to itself\"; J. B. Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know. Presumably human beings have various capacities for thinking situations which are likewise independent of language. \n Question: Why are patients with speech disorders able to think without having adequate control of language? \n Options: (A) They use different concepts. (B)  They do not think linguistically. (C)  It still remains an unsolved mystery. (D)  Thinking is independent of language.",

Zoey sprang into action, putting herself between the snake and the kid.She got several snakebites and was rushed to an animal hospital.Her head swelled and she almost lost an eye, but with proper treatment, Zoey made a full recovery.                                                                  \nHachiko                                                                                                         \nHachiko, an Akita, was brought to Tokyo in 1924 by Ueno, a college professor. Every day Hachiko waited for him to return from work, meeting him at the train station at four.                                  \nThe following year, Ueno suffered a stroke at work and died.Unaware of his death, the dog still returned to the train station every day to await his owner.He became such a familiar presence there, in fact, that the station master set out food for the dog and gave him a bed in the station.Even so, every day at four, he hopefully waited by the tracks as the train pulled in, searching through the crowd for his master.Every day.For ten years.                                                                                            \nUpon his death in 1935, Hachiko was a national celebrity and a bronze statue of him was installed at Shibuya Station as a tribute.                                                                                  \nStubby                                                                                                          \nIn 1917 Stubby was adopted by a soldier, who trained him to drill and salute. His owner developed such a strong connection with him that when he was sent to war in Europe, he took Stubby along, hiding him on the ship bound for France.                                                                              \nStubby proved a war star.He served 18 months in the front lines and took part in seventeen battles.He kept watch, warned the soldiers of surprise attacks, and saved the wounded in no man's land.He once found a German spy and held him by the seat of the pants until American soldiers arrived. Stubby was eventually a highly decorated dog, winning various medals and awards. A group of French\nwomen made Stubby a blanket decorated with allied flags to display his medals. \nWant to read more about dogs?

            "input": "Article: Have you thought about what determines the way we are as we grow up? Remember the TV program Seven Up ? It started following the lives of a group of children in 1963. We first meet them as wide-eyed seven-year-olds and then catch up with them at seven-year intervals ( )  : nervous  14-year-olds , serious  21-year-olds , then  grown-ups.\n     Some of the stories are inspiring ,others sad ,but what is interesting in almost all the cases is the  way  in which  the  children's early hopes and dreams are  shown  in their future lives, for example ,at seven ,Tony is a lively child who says he wants to become a sportsman or a taxi driver. When he grows up, he goes on to do both.  How about Nicki ,who says, \"I'd like to find out about the moon. \" and goes on to become a space scientist.  As a child, soft - spoken Bruce says he wants to help \"poor children\" and ends up teaching in India.\n      But if the lives of all the children had followed this pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up? Are children influenced by what their parents do ,by what they see on television ,or by what their teachers say? How great is the effect of a single important event? Many film directors ,including Stephen Spielberg ,say that an early visit to the cinema was the turning point in their lives.  Dr. Magaret  Mc Allister ,who has done a lot of research in this area ,thinks that the major influences are parents , friends and the wider society. \n Question: In the TV program Seven Up ,we can meet  _  . \n Options: (A) different groups of people at different periods of their lives (B)  different groups of people at the same period of their lives (C)  the same group of people at different periods of their lives (D)  the same group of people at the same period of their lives",

The change is bound to take place, but the global warming and climate change are changing the earth's landscape   rapidly,causing panic worldwide.\nExperts say that the Arctic sea ice is melting   quite faster than expected and it can affect not just the region, but Earth in general. A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape. \n Question: What does the author think of global warming and climate change? \n Options: (A) Indifferent. (B)  Anxious. (C)  Unbelievable. (D)  Misunderstood.",

He could, for instance, remember which brand of tea Mrs. Smith usually bought or what sort of washing-powder Mrs. Jones preferred. Not only was the shop a center of buying and selling, but also a social meeting place.\nA prosperous general store might have employed four or five assistants, and so there were very few problems in management as far as the staff was concerned. But now that the supermarket has replaced the general store, the job of the manager has changed completely. The modern supermarket manager has to cope with a staff as many as a hundred, apart from all the other everyday problems of running a large business.\nEvery morning, the manager must, like the commander of an army division, carry out an inspection of his store to make sure that everything is ready for the business of the day. He must see that everything is running smoothly. He will have to give advice and make decisions as problems arise, and he must know how to get his huge staff to work efficiently with their respective responsibilities.\nNo matter what he has to do throughout the day, however, the supermarket manager must be ready for any emergency that may arise.

This is because the color red is said to bring good fortune. In many Eastern weddings, especially Chinese weddings, the bride will change into a different dress after the ceremony. White dresses only arrived in modern times because of the influence of Western wedding dress designs.\nWestern wedding dresses are different. Brides usually wear a wedding dress that is white in color and wear it throughout the whole wedding. Wearing white wedding dresses is said to have started in the 1840s, beginning with Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain. There are occasions when brides dress into more comfortable clothing so that they will be able to move more freely during the wedding reception.\nTraditional practices are strictly followed for most Western weddings. The couple follow up with any plans they have agreed and decided on to make their special wedding day unique and memorable. Wedding receptions and other celebrations differ among the East and the West, but the concept is still the same. They are held to show gratitude towards family members, friends and guests for being a part of the wedding ceremony.\nAnother common custom that weddings of the East and the West have is the wearing of the wedding veil .

Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home. \n Question: What can we infer about northeast England from the passage? \n Options: (A) It is one of the poorest regions in England. (B)  It has experienced a severe loss of professionals. (C)  It will face a more serious brain drain in the near future. (D)  It is losing its young talents to other parts of the world.",

The change is bound to take place, but the global warming and climate change are changing the earth's landscape   rapidly,causing panic worldwide.\nExperts say that the Arctic sea ice is melting   quite faster than expected and it can affect not just the region, but Earth in general. A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape. \n Question: What is the passage mainly about? \n Options: (A) According to some experts, the Arctic may be free from ice soon because of global warming and climate change.

            "input": "Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language. \n Question: The writer mentioned the experiment of Frederick to    _   . \n Options: (A) support his idea (B)  introduce his topic (C)  describe a new finding (D)  give an example of his theory",

Reading, writing and speaking are also very important to the job. Fish scientists need to read the research of other scientists. They must be able to write up their own research clearly so that others can follow it. They also need to be able to give lectures about their findings, so that they can spread knowledge.\nIchthyologists who wish to specialize can choose any one of three areas of study. The first area is aquaculture. This involves the study and practice of fish farming and management. Because it is a rather new study, there are very few job opportunities available. However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own. You also need to be able to handle equipment and perform experiments; but most importantly, you must love fish. To become an ichthyologist, you will need to train at a university to pass a Bachelor of Science degree. For this, you will need to be good at mathematics, physical science and biology.

Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet. Much other matters far more: relying, sharing, giving, getting, enjoying; a sympathetic ear always there; criticism when it can help; praise -- even if only because it would help. With not many people on this earth will you find this much in common. When you find one, hang on to him, for a good friend found is a rare treasure. \n Question: What is the main idea of Paragraph three ? \n Options: (A) One is lucky to have many friends. (B)  A friend should have a good character. (C)  We should count our friends on more than one hand. (D)  A true friend should be treasured because there are few.",

While calming myself down with soft music, I started to recall what happened in the daytime and wrote it down.\nThe accident that gave me much thought happened on my way to the gym after work. When I walked about half way, I saw that many people surrounded something on the roadside and they were worried and shocked. I joined them and found there was a man lying on the ground. I noticed that he was a young man around 30 years old. He looked so pale and very thin. From his dressing, I simply judged that he worked in the office. The hospital ambulance came over and some nurses did the regular check for him. A nurse said that there was nothing serious with him but his body was very weak, which should be caused by overwork and less exercise.\nIt's a really sad thing for a young person to fall down in the street. A couple of days ago, I read a magazine mentioning that there is an increasing number of businessmen and white-collar workers with unhealthy bodies. Under huge pressure, they put all their time and energy to work and can't find enough time for a good meal or a good sleep, let alone exercise. But they forget that without health, work is equivalent to zero.\nAs I realize how important it is to put the health matter ahead, I am willing to do more exercise. I know exercise can bring me enjoyment and health. I know without health, even a most successful career and a great quantity of money will lose their meanings. \nWhen I got out of the gym, I felt that every cell in my body was refreshed and I was able to have more energy to write the words above.

All the road markings and signs are shown in two languages -- English and Welsh  . Not all visitors to Britain know that other languages are spoken here. There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh. People surf the Internet in Welsh, keep up with friends on Facebook and write blogs in Welsh.\nBy the way,\"Croeso I Gymru!\" means \"Welcome to Wales!\"  I hope you'll be able to visit it one day. \n Question: How does the author feel about the future of Welsh? \n Options: (A) Optimistic. (B)  Curious. (C)  Worried. (D)  Confused.",

Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.\nThe team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren't feeling sad.\n\"We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\" Thorstenson said in a statement. \"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way.\"\nThorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.\nThe team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn't do that in a specific order. The entire group was then tasked with identifying the colors in 48 continued color changes. The group that had been shown the sad clip was measurably worse at identifying colors along the blue-yellow axis.\nFor the second study, 130 participants were randomly assigned to watch either a sad clip or a neutral   one.

Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home. \n Question: Why does the author say education has become a global enterprise? \n Options: (A) Monkseaton High School used to be a very unfashionable school in the Northeast England. (B)  Monkseaton High School is now one of the state-funded middle schools in England.

It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed. The tower was reopened for the general public on December 15, 2001.\nIn May 2008, after removing another 70 metric tons of earth, the engineers announced that the tower had been finally stabilized and it would remain stable for at least 200 years. \n Question: The Leaning Tower of Pisa began to lean probably because   _  . \n Options: (A) it was too high like a pole (B)  its foundation shook badly (C)  the work of repair was delayed (D)  the soil of its foundation was too weak",

In the late 1990s, he was working in Nepal when his return flight was canceled. A delay gave him time to take a fourteen-day hiking trip in the Himalayas.\nOne day he looked in the window of a school and noticed how dark it was. This is a common problem for millions of children around the world. Many families use kerosene oil   lamps. There are many problems with these lamps. They produce only a small amount of light. They are dangerous to breathe. And they are a big fire danger, causing many injuries and deaths each year. Kerosene costs less than other forms of lighting, but it is still costly in poor countries. Professor Irvine says many people spend over 100 dollars a year on the fuel.\nWhen he returned to Canada, he began researching ways to provide safe and clean lighting. He began experimenting with light-emitting diodes  , LEDs, at his lab. As a professor of renewable energy, he already knew about the technology. Light-emitting diodes are small glass lamps that use much less electricity than traditional bulbs   and last much longer. He used a one-watt bright white LED made in Japan. He found it on the Internet and connected it to a bicycle-powered generator  . He remembers thinking it was so bright that a child could read by the light of a single diode.\nIn 2000, after much research and many experiments, he returned to Nepal to put the systems into homes. Now the homes of 25,000 people in 51 countries have been equipped with it. \"The one-time cost of our system which basically lives forever, as well as the solar panel -- is less than one hundred dollars.

TV critics Raymond Zhou will give you an idea of why some shows are better than others.\nPeriod drama--More than time travel\n    Period dramas are intended to capture the ambience   of a particular era. Directors must therefore attract audiences as much by their recreation of a historical setting as by an interesting storyline.www.ks5u.com\n    Mad Men is an excellent example of this balance being struck. Set in New York during the 1960s, it accurately shows US attitudes in the workplace through the alcoholism and chain-smoking common of the time, and places an absorbing plot right in its center.\n    But rather than merely presenting a past decade, Mad Men's subtle   description of the struggles of white-collar workers at the time, both male and female, makes it stand out.\n    \"The series' attention to detail is superb,\" Raymond Zhou said. \"For example, creator Matthew Weiner makes Don Draper--the leading role of the series--drive a Buick instead of a Cadillac, because Weiner thinks the ad man lacks the self-pride to buy a luxury car. It's this kind of attentiveness that raises the show's artistic value.\"\nCritics also recommend\n    Another period drama that works is Broadwalk Empire, set during the prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n    Heather Havrilesky at Salon magazine noted how the show \"revels in the oddities  of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a shadow world of criminals and politicians working together to keep the liquor flowing.\"www.ks5u.com\n                 Why does it appeal to viewers?

            "input": "Article: Last Sunday I made a visit to some new neighbors down the block. No specific purpose in mind, just an opportunity to sit at the kitchen table, have some tea and chat. As I did so, it occurred to me how rare the Sunday visit has become.\nWhen I was a kid in the New Jersey of the 1960s, Sunday visits were routine. Most stores were closed and almost nobody worked. My family normally traveled eight city blocks to the home of my grandmother, where adults would sit on the front porch and chat while we children played hide-and-seek.\nThe Sunday visit was something to desire strongly. It was the repetition to church, our reward for and hour of devotion, and opportunity to take advantage of the fact that Dad was not at work, we were not in school, and there were no chores that couldn't wait until Monday. Sunday was, indeed, which means that there was one day when everyone seemed to have time for everybody else.\nSunday as a day of rest is, or was, so deeply rooted in the culture that it's surprising to consider that, in a short span of time, it has almost entirely lost this association.1In my childhood, it was assumed that everyone would either be home or visit someone else's home on Sunday. But now the question is, \"What do you plan to Do this Sunday?\" The answer can range from going to the mall to participating in a road to jetting to Montreal for lunch. _ \nI suppose I should be grateful to live in Maine, a state of small towns, abundant land tight relationships. Even though folks work as hard here as they do anywhere else, the state's powerfully rural cast still harbors at least remnants of the ethic of yesterday's America, where people had to depend on one another in the face of economic vagaries and a challenging environment.2 \n Question: The writer's general impression of the Sunday in the past was a day when  _  . \n Options: (A) everyone would pay a visit to some relative far away (B)  everyone seemed to be free and could have some leisure (C)  Dad was not at work while Mom was busy cleaning the house (D)  nearly every adult would go to church and children were not at school",

It comes as world leaders are talking about fighting global warming in Copenhagen, Denmark. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are the main cause of global warming, which leads to extreme weather and other conditions.\nLiving a low carbon life means trying to cut carbon dioxide emissions  in one's daily life. For example, burning less coal and oil, which produce CO\n. It means walking, biking or taking buses, rather than using a private car.\n\"A(H1N1) flu\" is also on Xinhua's list.

Many parents send children obsessed  with the web to \"Net Addiction Camps\" for treatment. But some camps use physical punishment or electrical shocks. In 2009, some young people died as a result of the extreme methods, which led to a nationwide discussion. In November, the Ministry of Health banned the use of physical punishment to keep children off the net and dropped the term \"net addiction \".

They were questioned about their use of several kinds of drugs and alcohol. The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html) \n Question: According to McArdle, which is most likely to have the drug abuse problem? \n Options: (A) 16-year-old Tom from a happy big family.

This rule states that people should sleep with their bedroom doors closed. Nighttime fires are most serious because the family is asleep and the discovery of fire is usually too late.\nA closed bedroom door gives extra protected by delaying the gases and fire, thus giving the family a few minutes to escape.\nAt the first sight of fire in a home, it is necessary for everyone to get out of the house, especially children and elderly persons who may need help.

For what more could you ask than comradeship during the peaks and valleys of life? To whom else but a close, valuable friend can you show off your successes and complain about your failures or losses?\nWhat is a \"good friend\"? How is he best described? Well, it has been my observation that although many will cry with you, few can sincerely rejoice   with you. Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet. Much other matters far more: relying, sharing, giving, getting, enjoying; a sympathetic ear always there; criticism when it can help; praise -- even if only because it would help.

As a volunteer I was providing emotional support for people with health related problems. Empathic listening really made a difference on how patients felt about their health problems. By sharing about their pain and suffering and my willingness to listen, they felt less alone.\nWe can make life easier for each other by becoming a better listener and encouraging each other to share our feelings. We can become a better listener by avoiding giving advice and trying to solve problems unless we are asked to do so. Pressuring others to solve their life problems--\"our ways\"-- is not helpful. Most people intuitively   know how to solve their own problems. As a listener it's important to be patient and not to interrupt the speaker. Let them know it's OK to talk about their feelings and support them in feeling their feelings.\nWhen one neither shares nor reaches out for support, he or she can remain a lonely mystery. Life can feel lonely when one keeps everything inside. Feeling alone with life problems can be worse than the problem itself. When we let a caring person listen to our life struggle, we will no longer feel alone with our struggle.

Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material. \n Question: Recycling has become the first choice for the disposal of rubbish because    _    . \n Options: (A) recycling causes little pollution (B)  other methods are more expensive (C)  recycling has great appeal for the jobless (D)  local governments find it easy to manage",

The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an \"Olympic winter carnival\".\nThe festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating.

A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape. \n Question: Why would the Earth become even hotter if the sea ice melted?

But using ambergris, which helps a perfume last longer, is strongly opposed by many people who think it is wrong to kill whales just so we can smell sweet. Joerg Bohlmann is neither a perfumer nor a whale expert. He's a plant biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But his discovery of a new plant gene   might push whales out of the perfume business.\nThe gene comes from fir trees, found throughout North America and commonly used as Christmas trees. The trees produce a chemical that can be used in perfume in place of ambergris-but _ . \"There's a problem that many people wouldn't consider. In the tree, the chemical is mixed with many others. That makes separation a challenge,\" Bohlmann says. \"lt's like trying to isolate sugar from a biscuit. \"\nThis is where science becomes useful. When Bohlmann learned that fir trees produce the ambergris-like chemical, he decided to use his gene know-how to find the instructions for how to make the ambergris-substitute.\nBohlmann found that gene and took it out of the tree cells. Then he did something that might sound strange to someone who doesn't work in genetics: Bohlmann put the gene from the tree into yeast   cells.\nYeast may sound familiar because it's used to make things like bread, wine and beer. Biologists like to work with yeast because it easily adopts new genes and changes its features and behaviour. When Bohlmann put the fir tree gene into the yeast, the yeast started making the same chemical that had been produced by the tree.\nPerfumers pay big money for ambergris because it is a fixative, which means it holds a smell in place on a person's body.\n\"Cheap perfumes smell good in the first hour or so and then everything is gone,\" explains Bohlmann. \"But expensive perfumes are much more stable.  Their smell lasts much longer, for hours or even a day after you apply them. \"\nThe new chemical, made from the tree genes, can be used as a fixative, too. And using yeast to make it is far cheaper than acquiring ambergris.\nBohlmann admits he never thought he'd get into the perfume business.

In spite of this, he managed to get to the university, but it was so expensive to study there that during the holiday he found it necessary to get two jobs at the same time so as to make enough money to pay for his studies.\nOne summer he managed to get a job in a butcher's shop during the day-time, and another in a hospital at night. In the shop, he learnt to cut meat quite nicely, so the butcher often left him to do all the serving  while he went to the back room to do the accounts . In the hospital , on the other hand, he was , of course , allowed  to do the simplest jobs, like helping to lift people and to carry them from one part of the hospital to another. Both at the butcher's shop and at the hospital, Tom had to wear white clothes.\nOne evening at the hospital, Tom had to carry a woman from her bed to the place where she was to have an operation. The woman was already feeling frightened at the thought of the operation before he came to get her, but when she saw Tom, that finished her.\n\"No! No!\" she cried. \"Not my butcher! I won't be operated on by my butcher!\" and fainted away . \n Question: The woman patient recognized Tom because    _   . \n Options: (A) he was wearing white clothes (B)  he had sold meat to her (C)  he was now working in the hospital (D)  he was going to operate on her",

Many studies of automobile accidents have shown that safety belts can save lives. One study showed that forty percent of those killed in auto accidents could have been saved if they had been wearing seat belts.\nUnfortunately, belts are worn only by a small percentage of drivers and passengers -- about fifteen percent in cities, and only nine percent in small towns. And safety belts cannot protect people who do not wear them.\nIn order to find out what kinds of people do wear seat belts, a study was made in several cities of the United States. The following facts were about those who use their safety belts:\n1. They do not smoke while driving.\n2. They have had more education than non-users.\n3. They know someone who was injured (but not killed) in an automobile accident.\nAdvertisements based on these facts have been printed in newspapers and magazines in order to teach people the importance of using seat belts. But these advertisements have not helped much. Some people believe there should be a law requiring drivers and passengers to use safety belts. In Australia, where there is such a law, deaths in auto accidents have decreased twenty-four percent. \n Question: The passage tells us that in Australia    _   . \n Options: (A) a law requires drivers and passengers to use seat belts (B)  about 50% of the drivers wear seat belts (C)  the importance of seat belts is advertised in newspapers and magazines (D)  the auto accidents have kept the same percent as in the US",

Caring people who I have turned to in difficult times helped me the most by listening and asking about my feelings.\nDuring one of my volunteer jobs at a local HIV and cancer clinic, I found the helpfulness of empathic   listening. As a volunteer I was providing emotional support for people with health related problems. Empathic listening really made a difference on how patients felt about their health problems. By sharing about their pain and suffering and my willingness to listen, they felt less alone.\nWe can make life easier for each other by becoming a better listener and encouraging each other to share our feelings. We can become a better listener by avoiding giving advice and trying to solve problems unless we are asked to do so. Pressuring others to solve their life problems--\"our ways\"-- is not helpful. Most people intuitively   know how to solve their own problems. As a listener it's important to be patient and not to interrupt the speaker. Let them know it's OK to talk about their feelings and support them in feeling their feelings.\nWhen one neither shares nor reaches out for support, he or she can remain a lonely mystery. Life can feel lonely when one keeps everything inside. Feeling alone with life problems can be worse than the problem itself. When we let a caring person listen to our life struggle, we will no longer feel alone with our struggle.

            "input": "Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language. \n Question: The reason why some children are backward in speaking is most probably that    _   . \n Options: (A) they are not able to learn language rapidly (B)  they are exposed to too much language at once (C)  their mothers do not respond enough to their attempts to speak (D)  their mothers are not clever enough to help them",

They all help us to know what is going on in the world and what other people are thinking about.\nDo you think you can communicate without words? A smile on your face shows you are happy or friendly. Tears in your eyes tell others that you are sad. When you put up your hand in class, the teacher knows you want to say something or ask a question. You shake your head, and people know you are saying \"No\". You nod and people know you are saying \"Yes\".\nOther things can also carry messages.

If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 10 million deaths each year by 2020. Half the people that smoke today, which is about 650 million people, will eventually be killed by tobacco.\nTobacco is the fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide. The economic costs of tobacco use are equally devastating  . In addition to the high public health costs of treating tobacco-caused diseases, tobacco kills people at the height of their productivity, depriving   families of breadwinners and nations of a healthy workforce. Tobacco users are also less productive while they are alive due to increased sickness. A 1994 report estimated that the use of tobacco resulted in an annual global net loss of 200 thousand million US dollars, a third of this loss being in developing countries.\nTobacco and poverty are closely linked. Many studies have shown that in the poorest households in some low-income countries as much as 10% of total household expenditure is on tobacco. This means that these families have less money to spend on basic items such as food, education and health care. It contributes to a higher _ rate, since money that could have been used for education is spent on tobacco instead. \n Question: According to the passage, tobacco affects a family in the following aspects EXCEPT   _  . \n Options: (A) relationship (B)  education (C)  health (D)  economy",

For what more could you ask than comradeship during the peaks and valleys of life? To whom else but a close, valuable friend can you show off your successes and complain about your failures or losses?\nWhat is a \"good friend\"? How is he best described? Well, it has been my observation that although many will cry with you, few can sincerely rejoice   with you. Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet.

Scientists have shown a new threat from this lifestyle that they call  \"muscular inactivity  \".\nSitting still for long periods of time leads to the buildup of substances   in the blood that are harmful to health. And exercise alone won't drive them away.\nMillions of people spend their days between car,office desk and the sofa in front of the TV. While the bad influences are well rocognized,it has been thought that they can be changed by regular trips to the gym or swimming pool.\nNow researchers say that is not enough. In addition to regular exercise,office workers need to keep moving while they work,by making regular trips to the printer,coffee machine or to chat with workmates.\nElin EkblomBak,an expert on health,says research shows long periods of sitting and lack    of \"whole body muscular movement\"  are strongly linked to obesity,heart disease and cancer,and a higher risk of death,regardless of   whether they take enough exercise.\n\"Everyone knows about the health benefits of regular exercise. But what we haven't realized before is that longperiod sitting down carries an extra risk that cannot be dealt with by taking exercise,\" Dr EkblomBak said,adding that sitting still should be recognized as a risk to health.\n\"It is important to have a fiveminute break from desk work every 45 minutes. Don't email workmates--walk across the office to give them the message. Take a coffee break or put the printer in the next room. I am a desk worker and I try to do it. It is not difficult but sometimes you get lost in your work and you forget about it.\"\nHowever,more studies are needed to confirm the ill effects of sitting for too long and ways of fighting them. But at present they conclude that  \"keep moving\"  should be added to the advice to \"keep exercising.\" \n Question: What does the author suggest office workers should do? \n Options: (A) Chat with workmates often.

But using ambergris, which helps a perfume last longer, is strongly opposed by many people who think it is wrong to kill whales just so we can smell sweet. Joerg Bohlmann is neither a perfumer nor a whale expert. He's a plant biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But his discovery of a new plant gene   might push whales out of the perfume business.\nThe gene comes from fir trees, found throughout North America and commonly used as Christmas trees. The trees produce a chemical that can be used in perfume in place of ambergris-but _ . \"There's a problem that many people wouldn't consider. In the tree, the chemical is mixed with many others. That makes separation a challenge,\" Bohlmann says. \"lt's like trying to isolate sugar from a biscuit. \"\nThis is where science becomes useful. When Bohlmann learned that fir trees produce the ambergris-like chemical, he decided to use his gene know-how to find the instructions for how to make the ambergris-substitute.\nBohlmann found that gene and took it out of the tree cells. Then he did something that might sound strange to someone who doesn't work in genetics: Bohlmann put the gene from the tree into yeast   cells.\nYeast may sound familiar because it's used to make things like bread, wine and beer. Biologists like to work with yeast because it easily adopts new genes and changes its features and behaviour. When Bohlmann put the fir tree gene into the yeast, the yeast started making the same chemical that had been produced by the tree.\nPerfumers pay big money for ambergris because it is a fixative, which means it holds a smell in place on a person's body.\n\"Cheap perfumes smell good in the first hour or so and then everything is gone,\" explains Bohlmann. \"But expensive perfumes are much more stable.  Their smell lasts much longer, for hours or even a day after you apply them. \"\nThe new chemical, made from the tree genes, can be used as a fixative, too. And using yeast to make it is far cheaper than acquiring ambergris.\nBohlmann admits he never thought he'd get into the perfume business. But now, he says, producers have been calling to find out how to use his technology in new perfumes. \n Question: It can be inferred from the passage that if a perfume contains ambergris,  _  . \n Options: (A) its user probably supports whale hunting (B)  it is probably very expensive (C)  its smell will last for about an hour (D)  there will be a whale symbol on the bottle",

Their study on players at eight clubs in England and Wales, in the British Journal o f Sports Medicine, showed nearly 4 out of 10 had cavities   and that athletes often had worse teeth than the general population. Regularly taking sugary foods is one possible explanation.\nThe dentists, from the International Centre for Evidence-Based Oral Health at University College London, examined 187 players' sets of teeth. They found 53% had dental erosion  , 45% were bothered by the state of their teeth and 7% said it affected their ability to train or play. Around 40% had cavities, compared with 30% of people of a similar age in the general population.\nProf Ian Needleman, one of the researchers, said:  \"These are individuals who otherwise invest so much in themselves so it's a surprising finding.\n\"There are two main groups - some have a catastrophic effect, they have very serious disease that stops them in their tracks and they cannot play or train.\n\"There Il be others experiencing pain affecting sleep or sensitivity every time they take a drink. \"\nAt this level of athlete, even small differences can be quite telling.\nNutrition is one of the primary suspects with having too many sugary or acidic foods during training potentially accounting for cavities and erosion.

But did you know that showering can also benefit your mind?\nA research by Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist from Yale University in the US interviewed over 3,000 people around the world. It turned out that nearly two-thirds of the interviewees said they had experienced new ideas in the shower and were more likely to have them in the shower than at work.\nSo why does a simple shower have such magic power? Science can explain it.\nShowering can help to raise our level of dopamine, a hormone   closely related to our creativity. \"People vary in terms of their level of creativity according to the activity of dopamine\", explained Alice Flaherty, a famous American neuroscientist. \"Taking a warm shower can make us feel relaxed and therefore make the dopamine level rise and bring 'Aha!' moment to us.\"\nBesides the chemical changes, showering may give you a break from what you feel you have been stuck with. Especially when you have thought hard all day about a problem, jumping into the shower can keep you from the outside world so that you can focus on your inner feelings and memories. In this way, according to American psychologist Shelley H. Carson, author ofYour Creative Brain, \"a showering hour may turn into an 'incubation   period' for your ideas.\"\nCompared with sitting in front of a computer, taking a shower is something we do less frequently in our daily life. When showering, we get a fresh experience with the change of location, temperature and humidity. \"New and unexpected experiences can lead to positive changes in thinking,\" explained Kaufman. \"Getting off the couch and jumping in the shower may create a distance and force you to think from a new point of view.\"\nShowering allows us to enjoy the creative juices of our minds, but it needn't just be the bathroom where you get your inspiration. For instance, Gertrude Stein, a female American writer and poet, got new ideas by driving around a farm and stopping at different cows until she found the one that most inspired her. So try to create your own way to free your mind, whether it's a walk near the ocean, a country drive or reading a book at home. \n Question: According to the article, what changes can showering cause? \n Options: (A) Bringing the terrible moment to us. (B)  Increasing the level of dopamine. (C)  Leading to boredom or tiredness. (D)  Setting the creative part of the brain free.",

Perhaps our worst mistake is believing that being thin means being loved, being special, and being cherished. We imagine what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal.

They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long.

The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged.

Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games.

Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.\nAs to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.\nIn order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\" \n Question: What do we know about\"Avatar\" from this passage? \n Options: (A) The story in it is a moving love story. (B)  It brings the producer $1 billion in   total. (C)  The story in it happens on an alien planet. (D)  \"It talks about humans and aliens friendship.\"",

Since his first major success Jaws in 1975, he has made one hit movie after another. These include the wildly popular series Indiana Jones, Jaws and ET.\nThose films are fun and lighthearted. But Steven Spielberg has also made serious films that were well received by critics   and movie audiences alike. The movie Saving Private Ryan is a good example. It is an American war movie in the traditional sense. But, the director's close attention to detail and historical facts also increased public interest in America's efforts during World War Two.\nThe film Schindler's List also takes place during World War Two. It tells the powerful story of a German businessman who worked to save Jews from Nazi Germany.\nSteven Spielberg was born in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946.His mother owned a restaurant and was also a musician. His father was an electrical engineer. Steven started making movies while he was growing up. He required his family and friends to pay twentyfive cents to see his films when they were completed. Steven Spielberg said this experience led him to produce the film Super Eight. It tells about a group of teenagers who join together to make a movie and uncover a mystery in the process.\nSteven Spielberg is one of the top directors in the film industry and also has many fans in China. When asked about the secret of his success, Steven Spielberg said that he owes much of his success and happiness to his wife and children.

Another music great, Smokey Robinson, has described Chuck Berry as \"the inspiration for all of today's rock 'n' roll guitarists.\" And, Anthony Kiedis calls him \"a musical scientist who discovered a cure for the blues.\"\n   On stage, he became known for his wild performances, and his \"duck walk\" that many musicians copied. But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n   Chuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal. He was born the fourth of six children. He started singing in church when he was six years old. His interest in music stuck with him. \n    A lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life, especially school. Chuck Berry and two friends were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car . He was released from prison four years later. But that would not be the last of his legal problems over the years.\nFilmmaker Taylor Hackford made a documentary called \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986. More than seventy-five artists and bands have done their own versions of Chuck Berry songs. Many have done several, including the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, included Chuck Berry in its first year of honors in 1986.

Now a similar principle is being employed to create an umbrella that protects people from the rain using nothing more than an invisible air force field.\nAir Umbrella, developed by a Chinese company and recently funded by Kickstarter, uses forced air rather than fabric to create a protective canopy that keeps people from getting wet in the rain.\nIt's a clever concept and designers have done a good job of answering several questions about the product. For instance, the sound generated by the device is minimal, especially when compared to the pitter-patter of the falling rain. It can create a protective canopy wide enough for two people to fit under and it performs well even in the heavy rain. The air shield   can be cut through by high winds, but given that regular umbrellas typically fold over in similar windy conditions, the air umbrella is still an upgrade.\nA few concerns do remain, however. For instance, the battery life is only about 15-30 minutes depending on the model, so you'll still want to walk briskly to your next destination when it's raining.

So the device might draw the _ of anyone else walking with you, or any helpless bystanders.\nThere are currently three different types to choose from if you're interested in investing. Air Umbrella-A is the lightest model, and is apparently designed specifically for females, according to the Chinese developers. It is about 12 inches in length and weighs a little over a pound, and it runs for 15 minutes per charge. Air Umbrella-B measures nearly 20 inches long and weighs 1.7 pounds, and lasts 30 minutes per charge. Finally, Air Umbrella-C also lasts 30 minutes, but is scalable between 20 and 32 inches depending on your needs. \n Question: How does the author present concerns about the Air Umbrella? \n Options: (A) By giving figures.

            "input": "Article: A\nLike many other parts of our lives today, education has become a global enterprise. In microcosm , my school is proof of just how global. Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home. \n Question: The students today tend to see the world as a much smaller place NOT because    _   . \n Options: (A) they are having more exposure to the television programs (B)  they are having easier access to the Internet (C)  they are having frequent travels to the other parts of the world (D)  they are having better communication with their parents",

            "input": "Article: It is evident that there is a close connection between the capacity to use language and the capacities covered by the verb \"to think\". Indeed, some writers have identified thinking with using words: Plato coined the saying, \"In thinking the soul is talking to itself\"; J. B. Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know. Presumably human beings have various capacities for thinking situations which are likewise independent of language. \n Question: According to the author, when we intend to describe our thoughts, we  _  . \n Options: (A) merely report internal speech (B)  have to search for proper words in the way we read (C)  are overwhelmed with vague imagery (D)  sometimes are not able to find appropriate words",

In addition to that, roads, parking lots, and yet more buildings are being constructed. The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven. But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden?\nWhether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or meadow grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs. If used more widely, green roofs could decrease a city's total energy costs, reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage   systems, and actually extend the life time of the roof itself. And green roofs do something else: They beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th. Now that's a great achievement.\nThe environmental nonprofit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs progamme.

They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\" \n Question: What's the purpose of catching such a huge squid? \n Options: (A) To make it into food.

No matter when you come to Antigua, you won't miss the Pacaya-tour companies.\nBut climbing Pacaya is no easy job. It is 2,560 meters high, and reaching the peak takes two to three hours of almost one-step-forward and two-step-back movements. As you climb, you hear the dull sounds of eruptions high above. Steaming, hot remains from recent eruptions begin to line the path as you are near the active peak: the McKenney Cone  . Just as though you were going to walk over to the edge of the cone, the road turns to the left and up to the relative safety of the old, inactive peak.\nMany tours are timed so that you arrive at the cone of the volcano in plenty of time for sunset and the full contrast between the erupting red lava and the darkening sky.

Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\" \n Question: A hand-raised jackdaw hesitates to take a preferred food when the feeder   _  . \n Options: (A) is looking away from the food (B)  is unfamiliar to the bird (C)  holds the food in his hand (D)  is looking at the food",

Now a similar principle is being employed to create an umbrella that protects people from the rain using nothing more than an invisible air force field.\nAir Umbrella, developed by a Chinese company and recently funded by Kickstarter, uses forced air rather than fabric to create a protective canopy that keeps people from getting wet in the rain.\nIt's a clever concept and designers have done a good job of answering several questions about the product. For instance, the sound generated by the device is minimal, especially when compared to the pitter-patter of the falling rain. It can create a protective canopy wide enough for two people to fit under and it performs well even in the heavy rain. The air shield   can be cut through by high winds, but given that regular umbrellas typically fold over in similar windy conditions, the air umbrella is still an upgrade.\nA few concerns do remain, however. For instance, the battery life is only about 15-30 minutes depending on the model, so you'll still want to walk briskly to your next destination when it's raining. Also, while the air shield might keep the rain away from you, it's likely to splash all that blown-away water onto anyone else like a sprinkler  . So the device might draw the _ of anyone else walking with you, or any helpless bystanders.\nThere are currently three different types to choose from if you're interested in investing. Air Umbrella-A is the lightest model, and is apparently designed specifically for females, according to the Chinese developers. It is about 12 inches in length and weighs a little over a pound, and it runs for 15 minutes per charge.

Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself.

Many times I've wanted to write for myself, for other women, for my parents, for my husband, and especially for my children. I would have liked to leave a legacy   of words explaining what it has meant to have twins. One reason that there is not a great deal written about being a mother of a new baby is that there is seldom a moment to think of anything else but the baby's needs.\nWith twins, I did not have a spare hand to write with.\nBefore my twins were born, my days were long and I had nothing to write about. After the twins' birth I did have something to write about, but I found myself facing not a pen and paper but milk bottles.\nSome nights, friends would visit. They would leave at 11 p.m., heading for bed, and for us the night was only just beginning. With twins, there is really no night. Each feeding lasts a long time. At 1:00 a.m., each of them would begin crying from hunger. At 4:00am, when I finally put them down, I felt exhausted.\nTwo years have passed since then and we've managed to live through it all. My days are still very full and even now there isn't one evening when I put the twins down for the night that I don't have a break.

As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine. \n It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  \nWe have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  \nA recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog?\n Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.  \n What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  \nWe prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings. \n Question: Which of the following is true according to the article? \n Options: (A) The story of the Anleys and their dog was too unique to be newsworthy. (B)  Most people surveyed choose to save their own dog rather than a human. (C)  It was in the 19th century that human beings started to love their pets. (D)  Human beings are more and more concerned with animals nowadays.",

Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.\nOn February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\" \n Question: Why is it usually difficult for experts to observe the squid? \n Options: (A) Because it moves too fast.

Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914.

Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material. \n Question: The returned plastic bottles in New York used to    _    . \n Options: (A) be turned into raw materials (B)  be separated from other rubbish (C)  have a second-life value (D)  end up somewhere underground",

            "input": "Article: It is common to consider learning as something that takes place in school, but much of human learning occurs outside the classroom, even from birth and people continue to learn throughout their lives.\nEven before they enter school, young children learn to walk, to talk, and to use their hands to use toys, food, and other objects. They use all of their senses to learn about the sights,sounds,tastes, and smells in their environments. They learn how to communicate with their parents, grandparents,\nfriends, and other people important to their world. When they enter school, children learn basic academic subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics, They also continue to learn a great deal outside the classroom. They learn which behaviors are likely to be rewarded and which are likely to be punished. They learn social skills for communicating with other children. After they finish school, people must learn to deal with the many major changes that affect their lives, such as getting married, raising children, and finding and keeping a job.\nBecause learning continues throughout our lives and affects almost everything we do, the study of learning is important in many different fields. Teachers need to understand the best ways to educate children. Psychologists, social workers, criminologists, and other human-service workers need to understand how certain experiences change people's behaviors. Employers, politicians, and advertisers make use of the principles of learning to affect the behavior of workers, voters, and consumers.\nLearning is closely related to memory, which is the storage of information in the brain. Psychologists who study memory are interested in how the brain stores knowledge, where this storage takes place and how the brain later outputs knowledge when we need it. In contrast, psychologists who study learning are more interested in behavior and how behavior changes as a result of a person's experiences. \n Question: The author thinks \"Learning\" in the passage most refers to    _    . \n Options: (A) life-long learning (B)  family learning (C)  learning after graduation (D)  behavior learning",

They were questioned about their use of several kinds of drugs and alcohol. The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html) \n Question: The phrase \"maternal bond\" refers to_. \n Options: (A) the education of mothers (B)  the supervision of mothers on children (C)  whether the mother uses drugs (D)  the guidance of schools on mothers",

Supported by the Ladies' Association in London for the promotion of female education in India and the East, she immediately took up the work of starting a girls' school for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the opening of a boys' school.\nMrs. Gutzlaff's comprador  happened to come from my village and was actually my father's friend and neighbor.

It has always been a mystery to me why my parents should put me into a foreign school, instead of a traditional Confucian school, where my big brother was placed. Most certainly such a step would have been more suitable for Chinese public opinion, taste, and the wants of the country, than to allow me to attend an English school. Moreover, a Chinese belief is the only avenue in China that leads to political promotion, influence, power and wealth. I can only guess that as foreign communication with China was just beginning to grow, my parents hoped that it might be worthwhile to put one of their sons to learning English. In this way he might become an interpreter and have a more advantageous position to enter the business and diplomatic world.

The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material. \n Question: The key problem in dealing with returned plastic beverage containers is    _    . \n Options: (A) how to reduce their recycling costs (B)  to sell them at a profitable price (C)  how to turn them into useful things (D)  to lower the prices for used materials",

We first meet them as wide-eyed seven-year-olds and then catch up with them at seven-year intervals ( )  : nervous  14-year-olds , serious  21-year-olds , then  grown-ups.\n     Some of the stories are inspiring ,others sad ,but what is interesting in almost all the cases is the  way  in which  the  children's early hopes and dreams are  shown  in their future lives, for example ,at seven ,Tony is a lively child who says he wants to become a sportsman or a taxi driver. When he grows up, he goes on to do both.  How about Nicki ,who says, \"I'd like to find out about the moon. \" and goes on to become a space scientist.  As a child, soft - spoken Bruce says he wants to help \"poor children\" and ends up teaching in India.\n      But if the lives of all the children had followed this pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up? Are children influenced by what their parents do ,by what they see on television ,or by what their teachers say? How great is the effect of a single important event?

There are guided tours every day up this highly active volcano from Antigua, giving travelers a chance to see Mother Nature at her most powerful.\nPacaya is an easy drive from Antigua, a beautiful city with many colorful houses along its old streets that are turned into art-works during its Holy Week festival. No matter when you come to Antigua, you won't miss the Pacaya-tour companies.\nBut climbing Pacaya is no easy job. It is 2,560 meters high, and reaching the peak takes two to three hours of almost one-step-forward and two-step-back movements. As you climb, you hear the dull sounds of eruptions high above. Steaming, hot remains from recent eruptions begin to line the path as you are near the active peak: the McKenney Cone  . Just as though you were going to walk over to the edge of the cone, the road turns to the left and up to the relative safety of the old, inactive peak.\nMany tours are timed so that you arrive at the cone of the volcano in plenty of time for sunset and the full contrast between the erupting red lava and the darkening sky. On a good day the view from the peak is extremely exciting. The active mouth boils, sending red lava over its sides, and once in a while shoots hot streams up to 100 metres into the air. \n Question: Many tours are timed for people to   _  . \n Options: (A) get down the mountain in time when night falls (B)  avoid the smell from the upwind direction of the cone (C)  enjoy the fantastic eruption against the darkening sky (D)  appreciate the scenery of the 2,560-metre-high mountain",

The extremely funny lecture is mainly an over-the-top mockery  of the fashion world, but Miss Lin makes a point: We need to hold steady in pressure-filled or embarrassing situations.\nHolding steady, Internet slang for \"staying poised\", is one of the qualities the public has been looking for lately as pressures on marriage, work and money can easily drive people crazy. The quality was demonstrated by a girl named Su Miaoling this year. The contestant in the TV singing competition\ncarried herself with an air of confidence on stage and kept her cool when others got anxious. \"I like your poise . Very few contestants on this stage can keep calm like you do,\" said one of the show's judges, Hu Haiquan, to Su. Internet users dubbed Su \"Sister Poise\".\nPoise is also appreciated in Western culture as an essential quality of a well-mannered person. Each year, the National League of Junior Cotillions of the US releases a list of the Ten Best Mannered People. Kate Middleton made it onto the list in 2011 \"for the poise and dignity with which she conducts herself in the public spotlight\". The Duchess of Cambridge was also acclaimed earlier this year for her remarkable poise at the royal wedding.\nGood news for many, poise is not genetic----it can be acquired with a bit of effort. A personal growth guidance gives tips on how to stay poised. \"Take a few deep breaths when you are facing a situation that tests your patience; practice yoga regularly to calm your nerves; use self-affirmation by saying 'I choose to be calm in any situation'; write down your affirmation daily to imprint the goal,\" reads the site. \n Question: The purpose of this passage is to   _   . \n Options: (A) introduce the Internet hot term \"hold steady\" (B)  tell funny stories about how to hold steady (C)  demonstrate how to keep calm under pressure (D)  give advice on how to keep cool in daily life",

One hundred years later, however, the Indians only had a very small part of the land that originally belonged to them. How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died. Between 1843 and 1854 the Indian population in one area of the country went down from 100,000 to 30,000.\nMore land was needed for the increasing number of white settlers. In Washington, the old respect for the rights of the Indians disappeared. The old promises to the Indians were broken; the government began to move groups of Indians from their original homelands to other poorer parts of the country. Some Indians reacted angrily and violently to this treatment. They began to attack white settlers, and the Indian war began. For 30 years, until the late 1880s, different groups of Indians fought against the injustices of the white man. They had a few famous successes, but the result of the struggle was never in doubt. There were too many white soldiers, and they were too powerful. Many Indians were killed; the survivors were moved from their homelands to different areas of the country. It was a terrible chapter in the history of a country that promised freedom and equality to everyone. \n Question: According to the passage which of the following is TRUE? \n Options: (A) The Indians believed that killing too many wild animals had disturbed the balance of nature.

In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors.

The crab's changing colour follows a regular twenty--four hour plan that exactly matches the daily rhythm   of the sun.\n    Does the crab actually keep time, or does its skin simply answer to the sun's rays, changing colour according to the amount of light strikes it? To find out, biologists kept crabs in a dark room for two months. Even without daylight, the crab's skin colour continued to change exactly on time.\n    This characteristic   probably developed gradually in answer to the daily rising and setting of the sun, to help protect the crab from sunlight and enemies. After millions of years it has become completely regulated   inside the living body of the crab.\n    The biologists noticed that once each day the colour of the fiddler crab is especially dark, and that each day this happens fifty minutes later than on the day before.

I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife's income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that.

The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.\nAs to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.\nIn order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\" \n Question: Who first created the basic words of the Na'vi language? \n Options: (A) Paul Frommer.

Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material. \n Question: What regulation was issued by New York State concerning beverage containers? \n Options: (A) A fee should be charged on used containers for recycling. (B)  Throwaways should be collected by the state for recycling. (C)  Consumers had to pay for beverage containers and could get their money back on returning them.

Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \"toy bear\". And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced(,), and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling ,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language. \n Question: If a child starts to speak later than others, he will    _    in future. \n Options: (A) have a high IQ (B)  be less intelligent (C)  be insensitive to verbal signals (D)  not necessarily be backward",

The day was founded in 1999 to celebrate the incredible companionship dogs provide and to encourage animal adoption.\nDogs have been having their day for some time now. Everywhere you look, there is some kind of pet-project going on, which for a dog lover like me, is a dream come true.\nThere are dogs starring in reality TV. Doggy day care is in high demand. Big well-known companies like Paul Mitchell, Omaha Steaks, and Harley Davidson have all jumped on the gravy-train   offering pet products including shampoos, food and clothes. The pet insurance business is booming. And, luxury hotels and apartment buildings are also catering to our furry friends, finally.\nMake no bones about it, the pet industry is a multi-billion dollar business. According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It's estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.\nThat's a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  . Since then, dogs have become faithful companions not only at home but also as service dogs, in the workplace and on the battlefield.\nIn addition to the unconditional love, companionship and sense of security that comes with dog ownership, there are also many health benefits. Research shows that owning a pet can help a person increase their amount of exercise, reduce their stress and lower their blood pressure.\nAnd if that's not enough good news, here's more. The entire week is \"Take Your Pet to Work Week\" so there's no need to go to the office without your furry or even feathered (if your pet is a bird) friend. \n Question: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage? \n Options: (A) Take Your Dog to Work Day (B)  Dogs are Popular Nowadays (C)  Human Beings and Dogs (D)  Benefits from Dogs",

So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself. Do not move about or kick up dust. \n Question: What should people NOT do when they are trapped in debris? \n Options: (A) Cover their mouth with a handkerchief. (B)  Tap on a pipe or wall for help.

This was the start of an interesting week.\nThe old man sat down, made himself at home, and gifted us the dog. After a brief visit, he left, and we were now the proud owners of this dog. It takes experience and knowledge to know that our lifestyle can't satisfy the needs of this dog; the owner that gifted us the dog was mismatched for him as well.\nThree attempts to return the dog to his old owner failed. (I think he was avoiding us.) Because our lifestyle didn't allow us to give this poor dog the attention he needed, he disturbed the neighbors. They got involved. After we shared the story, they gained a new perspective and wisely stepped in to help us find a solution.\nOne week later it was decided that dog would be picked up from us by the old neighbor. He would then return it to the previous owner who was more equipped to care for it.\nWhen faced with unexpected challenges in life, it helps to see everyone's perspective. We have to look at one another's perspective to solve a problem with honesty, experience and knowledge. That's the sign of a leader. Although the old neighbor typically has little to do with leadership, it did bring a neighborhood together to understand one another and work as a team to solve a problem. \n Question: What does the author intend to stress in the text? \n Options: (A) The value of team spirit.

With the city's population expected to increase only slightly and the economy to boom by 2020, Chen Yin, an official with the water authority, said Shanghai's water use will not increase from its present amount.\nZhang Yue, director of the Urban Construction Division under the Ministry of Construction, said, \"Shanghai is the first city in the country to publicize these goals. They will not be easy to achieve.\"\nHe said water saving will help keep the sustainable  development of China's economy.\nSaving one cubic meter of water means saving the city's infrastructure costs by 10,000 Yuan. Last year, Shanghai saved 300 million cubic meters of water either from readjustment of industrial structure or the use of new technology.\n\"The aim is to arouse public awareness of the seriousness of water shortages,\" Chen said. \"The rich surface water and amount of rain of the city are so misleading that they result in improper use of water.\"\nShanghai lacks drinkable water. The Huangpu River, which supplies 80 percent of the city's drinkable water, is drying up.\nThe city, therefore, has been exploring new sources from the Yangtze River and growing forests along it to hold quality water.\nBesides, the authority is popularizing technology among the public to efficiently cut the amount of water used.\nAt present, the city has 600,000 family toilets, each using 13 liters of water per flush. These are to be renovated to use only 9 liters of water per flush.\nThe authority is renovating the first 200 toilets for households - at a cost of 40 Yuan each.\nIn three years, all the toilets will be renovated, which saves the city nearly 15 million Yuan every year in water use.\nAnother task is the treatment of the waste water to improve the water environment.\nAt present the city can only treat 44 percent of its daily 5.04 million tons of waste water. To meet the total demand, 27 more treatment factories are to be set up with an estimated investment of 18 billion Yuan. \n Question: Some people in Shanghai use water improperly because_. \n Options: (A) the rich surface water and large amount of rain mislead them (B)  their family toilets can save plenty of water (C)  the waste water has already been treated (D)  new technology provide people with water as much as possible",

You forget about dairy and head for the bakery   section. Guess what? You just walked into an odor   trap  ! The odor was cooked up by scientists in a lab.\nFor years, scientists have been studying the special powers of smell. They found that more than our other senses, smell changes our mood and helps us remember things.\nSo companies have begun spending thousands of dollars to scent   entire stores. Artificial   scents are being used to lead customers by the nose. These smells help to get people inside and put them in the mood to buy. They even make customers remember the store later, so they'll come back for more. Also, many companies have smartly made use of product smells. A company added lemon fragrance to its dish cleaner. They wanted people to think the soap contained \"natural\" cleaners. It worked!\nNew uses for smells are being created every day. One bank, for example, gives customers coupons   advertising car loans  . To get people to take out a loan, bank officials hope to coat these coupons with the fresh leather smell of a new car. In Australia, telephone offices are putting sweat odor on unpaid bills. Since some people sweat when they're scared, this smell might remind them of when they were frightened. And they'll pay the bills right away!\nWhat lies ahead for our noses? Smell scientists are working on some pretty far-out ideas. Would you believe TV sets that produce smells? Or how about scent diets? Certain food smells will fool your stomach into thinking it's full. Alarm clocks will scent your bedroom with a strong pleasant smell designed to wake you up. Scientists are even working on ways to keep garbage from smelling.

Therefore, the teacher should realize that parents have a great influence on their children. Parents can become strong allies   of the school or they can get in the way of the school education.\nExperts have realized the need to keep parents informed of the newer methods used in schools. Many headmasters have conducted workshops explaining such matters as the reading readiness, program writing and mathematics to parents.\nMoreover, the classroom teacher, with the permission of the supervisors , can also play an important part in giving more knowledge to reporting pupils progress, teachers can help parents a lot in educating their children and parents can give much help to teachers.\nSuppose that a father has been drilling Junior arithmetic lessons night after night. In a friendly talk between the teacher and the father, the teacher can help the parent to make Junior interested in it.

Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\".

How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died.

Mad Men, which returned with a sixth season recently; Monday Mornings, which just finished its first season; and Modern Family, which sweeps the awards every year, are just a few examples.\nWhy do these shows stand out among so many similar ones? TV critics Raymond Zhou will give you an idea of why some shows are better than others.\nPeriod drama--More than time travel\n    Period dramas are intended to capture the ambience   of a particular era. Directors must therefore attract audiences as much by their recreation of a historical setting as by an interesting storyline.www.ks5u.com\n    Mad Men is an excellent example of this balance being struck. Set in New York during the 1960s, it accurately shows US attitudes in the workplace through the alcoholism and chain-smoking common of the time, and places an absorbing plot right in its center.\n    But rather than merely presenting a past decade, Mad Men's subtle   description of the struggles of white-collar workers at the time, both male and female, makes it stand out.\n    \"The series' attention to detail is superb,\" Raymond Zhou said. \"For example, creator Matthew Weiner makes Don Draper--the leading role of the series--drive a Buick instead of a Cadillac, because Weiner thinks the ad man lacks the self-pride to buy a luxury car. It's this kind of attentiveness that raises the show's artistic value.\"\nCritics also recommend\n    Another period drama that works is Broadwalk Empire, set during the prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n    Heather Havrilesky at Salon magazine noted how the show \"revels in the oddities  of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a shadow world of criminals and politicians working together to keep the liquor flowing.\"www.ks5u.com\n                 Why does it appeal to viewers?

But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n   Chuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal.

Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986.

(C)  They felt much pressure from the public (D)  They paid little attention to fame and fortune.",

We have instant satisfaction, fast food, speed reading, mobile phones; even the stress management books have titles like \"Stress Management in 60 Seconds\".\nCanadian Classics Professor Margaret Visser points out that the perception that we have \"no time\" is one of the most strict concepts of Western culture. Visser says that \"no time\" is used as an excuse and also as a spur ; it both stimulates us and forces us, just as a concept such as 'honour' did for the ancient Greeks. According to Visser, the feeling that Westerners have \"no time\" is abstract, quantitative, amoral , unarguable, bringing pressure on each person as an individual. At the same time, the \"no time\" excuse escapes\nby claiming to be a condition created entirely out of our good fortune.\nLife offers \"so many pleasures, so many choices\".\nThe fact that women now work outside the home has contributed to the \"no time\" trend. But more important, Visser says, is the fact that feeling rushed has become an important component  of our economy. Marketing of \"time-saving\" products causes people to buy more and work longer. So we eat out or buy prepared food to save time. The fax-it-to-my-car technology only contributes to the constant hurry. In our rushed and exhausted state, even the obligation  to sit down to casual meal with family seems like a pressure. In comparison with the decision to act on a sudden whimz   to consume a microwave mug of soup, the act of eating together and not getting up from the table until everyone else has finished seems an incredibly time-consuming event. Being in one's own personal hurry in the West is somehow \"free and preferable\" \n Question: We can learn from the passage that \"no time\" trend    _   . \n Options: (A) brings pressure on the individual (B)  is very desirable to the individual (C)  is not harmful if you have no control of events (D)  has caused heart diseases and psychological problems",

Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.\nOn February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\" \n Question: What can be inferred from the passage? \n Options: (A) The squid is from a science fiction story.

They work not only inside a laboratory, but also out in the field. Fieldwork includes traveling to rivers, oceans and lakes in order to collect information and specimens. Reading, writing and speaking are also very important to the job. Fish scientists need to read the research of other scientists. They must be able to write up their own research clearly so that others can follow it. They also need to be able to give lectures about their findings, so that they can spread knowledge.\nIchthyologists who wish to specialize can choose any one of three areas of study. The first area is aquaculture. This involves the study and practice of fish farming and management. Because it is a rather new study, there are very few job opportunities available. However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own. You also need to be able to handle equipment and perform experiments; but most importantly, you must love fish. To become an ichthyologist, you will need to train at a university to pass a Bachelor of Science degree. For this, you will need to be good at mathematics, physical science and biology. Then, you will need to study for another year to complete an honors degree in ichthyology. This honors degree contains coursework about all aspects of fish. You also need to complete a research paper. \n Question: The passage is probably written for   _  . \n Options: (A) university students (B)  science researchers (C)  fisheries experts (D)  fish farmers",

Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material. \n Question: It can be concluded from the passage that    _    . \n Options: (A) recycling is to be suggested both economically and environmentally (B)  local governments in the U. S. can expect big profits from recycling (C)  rubbish is a potential remedy for the shortage of raw materials (D)  landfills will still be widely used for waste disposal",

According to the regulations issued by the China National Tourism Administration (NTA), tour guides and leaders have the right to report on bad behaviors to the government.

Along with making sure you are appropriately dressed, your dog should also be properly protected from the elements. Some large breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds and Huskies can tolerate the colder weather better than others. These dogs may also develop a thicker coat over time as they are exposed to colder weather.\n Smaller breeds, however, like Chihuahuas and Miniature Pinschers, breeds with short coats and puppies should wear some type of protection, i.e, a coat or sweater, if the temperature drops too low. Look for coats or sweaters with high collars or a turtleneck that covers your dog from the base of the tail on top to the belly underneath.\n Dog booties   provide good protection from chemicals or salts on the pavement as well as mud. If you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside.\n Other tips\nWhen you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. It is especially important to keep your dog well groomed   during the winter months to protect him from the elements.\n If your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. Dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced.\n The amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age. Remember that ill or elderly dogs are more sensitive to cold weather. Dogs whom cold weather agrees with can spend hours outside without getting cold but some of the smaller and younger dogs' exercise sessions should be kept shorter.

That puts the work you love somewhere off in the distant future. Rather, think of yourself as an artist, supporting yourself by waiter tables--and paint, or draw as much as you can. It is possible to earn a living wage as a waiter working 24 hours a week. That leaves plenty of time to devote to training or developing your craft in the off hours.\nWhile seeking the work you love, it helps to expand your awareness  into the universe of all possibilities. You don't want to be limited to the ideas of what you should do or what you have done before. Having opened to all possibilities, you can make a final decision and select the work you love as your own.\nDoing the work you love requires that you be equally comfortable with the imaginative and the practical.

It has little to do with the usual challenges, such as flood, rising fuel prices and crop-eating insects. The country's farmers are getting older, and there are fewer people standing in line to take their place. National agricultural census   figures show that the fastest-growing group of farmers is the part over 65. Merrigan is afraid the average age will be even higher when the 2012 statistics are completed.\nMerrigan, a former college professor, is making stops at universities across the country in hopes of encouraging more students to think about careers in agriculture. Aside from trying to stop the graying of America's farmers, her work is made tougher by a recent blog posting that put agriculture at No. 1 on a list of \"useless\" college degrees. Top federal agriculture officials are talking about the posting, and it has the attention of agricultural organizations across the country.\n\"There couldn't be anything that's more incorrect,\" Merrigan said. \"We know that there aren't enough qualified graduates to fill the jobs that are out there in American agriculture.\"\nIn addition, a growing world population that some experts predict will require 70% more food production by 2050, she said.\n\"I truly believe we're at a golden age of agriculture.

The National Young Farmers' Coalition has also been pushing for state and federal policy changes to make it easier for new farmers.\nRyan Best, president of Future Farmers of America, has been living out of a suitcase, traveling the country and visiting with high school students about careers in agriculture. The 21-year-old Best hopes his message --that this is a new time in agriculture-- will motivate the next generation\n. \"Never before have we had the innovations   in technology which have led to agriculture in this country being the most efficient it has ever been,\" he said. \"There's really a place for everybody to fit in. \" \n Question: What is the new challenge to American agriculture? \n Options: (A) Fewer and older farmers.

It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed. The tower was reopened for the general public on December 15, 2001.\nIn May 2008, after removing another 70 metric tons of earth, the engineers announced that the tower had been finally stabilized and it would remain stable for at least 200 years. \n Question: People noticed the Leaning Tower of Pisa shift its direction   _  . \n Options: (A) as soon as it was constructed (B)  during the construction (C)  at the end of the construction (D)  as soon as it was completed",

Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess. \n Question: What did the scientists think before 1998? \n Options: (A) The universe would expand faster. (B)  Empty space was full of dark energy. (C)  The universe would expand more slowly. (D)  There was nothing in the space.",

We know the popular story of this voyage and the rebellion, in which Bligh has been presented as hard, violent and thoroughly unpleasant captain. However, there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that this picture is far from being true. He seems to have been unusually thoughtful about the health and welfare of his men. For example he made sure that his crew got exercise, insisted on cleanliness on his ship, and adopted the practice of giving them a drink which prevented scurvy every day.\nWhen Captain Bligh arrived in Tahiti, it became clear that it would be some months before the breadfruit trees were ready to be taken to the West Indies. Instead of going off right away, he gave his crew extended shore leave. This may have been a mistake as many were unhappy about leaving when the time came. Finally, on the return journey the rebellion took place. The ship was under the command of the rebels and Captain Bligh had to leave in a small boat.\nCaptain Bligh's achievement was to get to dry land successfully. It is one of the supreme examples of seamanship. Apart from Bligh there were 18 members of his crew sailing in an open boat about 23 feet long and 7 feet wide. They took with them 25 gallons of water, 150 pounds of bread and 30 pounds of pork. They had no guns or other weapons. The boat was so low in the water that it seemed likely to sink at any time. On one occasion Captain Bligh tried to land on an island to get more water. He and his men were attacked by hostile natives and one of the crew was killed. At this point Bligh decided to sail directly to the Dutch settlement on the island of Timor without stopping. The distance was about 4,000 miles. The voyage took about 42 days and he had no advanced navigational equipment. However, his skill and commitment proved equal to the task and amazingly no one else died. It was truly a remarkable achievement. \n Question: It may have been a mistake that Bligh gave his crew extended shore leave because it caused   _  . \n Options: (A) the lack of drink (B)  the death of the tress (C)  the unhappiness about leaving (D)  the challenges facing the small boat",

By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.\nAbout one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west.

The extremely funny lecture is mainly an over-the-top mockery  of the fashion world, but Miss Lin makes a point: We need to hold steady in pressure-filled or embarrassing situations.\nHolding steady, Internet slang for \"staying poised\", is one of the qualities the public has been looking for lately as pressures on marriage, work and money can easily drive people crazy. The quality was demonstrated by a girl named Su Miaoling this year. The contestant in the TV singing competition\ncarried herself with an air of confidence on stage and kept her cool when others got anxious. \"I like your poise . Very few contestants on this stage can keep calm like you do,\" said one of the show's judges, Hu Haiquan, to Su.

Yet, at the end of the effort, not much changes. What happens?\nIn most cases, those new plans, programs and employees enter a company with an existing culture  . And plans, programs and new employees have a way of conforming to the existing culture. The culture of your business is the result of a particular mindset, or a particular way of thinking and the general feelings about certain things. Most often, it is the mindset of the founder or people managing the business.\nThe founder has gotten to where he is because of his skill sets, knowledge base and personal beliefs, which unfortunately all come with inherent  limits. Why Skills, knowledge and beliefs come from what he or she already knows or has experienced. In other words, it comes from the past. We (people) try to make the past fit the future. Just because something worked in the past, doesn't mean it is suitable for the future. As the saying goes, if you do and think what you have always done and thought, you will have what you have always had.\nTherefore, lasting changes have to start with the way people think. To make changes in the way you think, you will be required to set goals beyond your basic abilities and continuously think them through. It is a way to train yourself and people to get out of the comfort zone where you feel happy with your knowledge and skills. \n Question: Which question does the author try to answer? \n Options: (A) What past experience is useful for businesses (B)  How much time is needed for making plans (C)  How can changes be made in businesses (D)  What kinds of employees are the best",

In other words, they have more chances to choose a good job while people with little or no education don't. It seems that the purpose of education is to make people get jobs. But this isn't accepted by all people.\nSome people may think that a person should spend the best years of his life to get education only for a way of living. This was probably one of the earliest reasons of education. In fact, if education is just a way of making a living, people don't need to spend so much time in school. People can get education for a living in a short time. Subjects like history and geography need not be taught to everyone. Even language and mathematics need not be taught in detail , either. Here it is clear that education is much more than teaching a man to get a way of living.\nEducation is well-rounded and it is mainly for improving a man. It is not only to teach him to speak, read and write, but also to develop his creative thinking and other abilities. After that, it is to make him a wise man and thankfully enjoy the achievements of human. Education is to make a man lead a better life. Educated people are expected to be able to listen to good music, read good books, watch plays and most of them take an interest in the world.\nI would agree that making a good living is an important reason for education, but certainly not the most important or the main reason. \n Question: People with little education usually    _   . \n Options: (A) spend a long time in school (B)  have a good chance to get a job (C)  spend the best years to choose jobs (D)  have fewer chances to get a good job",

Traditionally, spas were places with a natural spring producing warm waters that could be used in hydrotherapy   treatments. They were places where you \"took the waters\" --- meaning you drank some of the water or bathed in it.\nBut nowadays, a \"spa\" can mean a variety of things. In general, the term is often used to refer to commercial establishment that provides many services for health, fitness, weight loss, beauty and relaxation. This may include exercise classes, mud baths, body treatment, facials  , etc.\nIn Japan, traditional hot springs have attracted visitors for centuries. And thermal baths   have been found in the ruins of the Cretan Palace of Knossos (2000-1400 B.C.). It was the Romans who made spas popular in Europe. They established a number of towns around thermal waters. These include the English town of Aquae Sulis (which is called Bath today), and the Belgian town of Aquae Spadanae (which is known as Spa these days).\nIn the 18\ncentury, spas became the fashionable places to go on holiday. Bath and Harrogate in the UK were popular with British rich people. And in Europe Carsbad (now called Larlovy Vary), Marienbad and Franzensbsf were Europe's most important holiday centers.\nA typical day in Carsbad in the 19\ncentury went as follows. Visitors got up at 6:00 a.m. to take the waters and listen to music by a band. Next, came a light breakfast, a bath in the waters, and then lunch. In the afternoon, visitors went sightseeing, walked or attended concerts. After dinner, there were theatrical performances. Guests returned to their hotels at about 9 p.m. to rest until six the following morning. Visitors would stay for as long as a month. Some of the more famous patients at these spas included the composers Beethoven and Chopin, and the Russian writer Turgnev.\nMarienbad was the best spa town. It was popular with the inventor Thomas Edison, the writer Johann Goethe, and many famous people and European emperors.\nToday, although taking the waters isn't as common as it used to be, spa treatments are more popular than ever. \n Question: At the spas in Carlsbad,    _   . \n Options: (A) many visitors had facials (B)  guests often stayed for at least a month (C)  Thomas Edison was a regular guest (D)  guests had a bath between breakfast and lunch",

So it is possible for many of them to do shopping through the Internet. Second, shopping through the Internet can save them some money and a lot of time. Third, they don't need to go to the shop themselves.  Because of these good facts, few people refuse it.\nOn the other hand, some people don't like this new way of shopping.

Today many young people stay inside watching television, playing computer games, or surfing the Internet. Rarely can people see children today, enjoying themselves outdoors, on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods.\n   Young people who join in after-school sports activities will be out of the house. They will be on the move, running and jumping, which is great exercise. They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player, whey they are part of an organized sport. They also learn about good sportsmanship, teamwork and gaining confidence. There are even sports that young athletes do better in school. Outdoor sports give children, teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine, which improve their over-all health. They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun, and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity  . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing.\n   Children do better in sports events, when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity. While track and field events may not be some small children's cup of tea, there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards. The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time. The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each, for a total of 6. Eight-year-old Jerel Rhodes II, won gold medals for the shot put  , and the discus   throw. Seven-year-old Jadyn Rhodes, received a silver medal fro the shot put, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter race. Five-year-old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800-meter race, as well as the discuss throw.\n   There is a down side to athletic activities. Not everyone will go home as a winner. If your child does not win a medal, you should not complain about him or her. You should be proud of him or her just for taking part. If a child feels bad about his or her performance, he or she may be teased by other children, or his or her parents may express disappointment. All these can have an effect on self-esteem. The bottom line is to get your children out of the house, and to be involved in activities that keep them moving. Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all. If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making, encourage --but do not push -- him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports.\nThe Mayo Clinic, an internationally famous medical research group, says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports. Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable, or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them. If you encourage those like the Rhodes family, who have the desire to play sports, they just might bring home a gold, silver or bronze medal. \n Question: What is the main advice that the author gives parents? \n Options: (A) Making children take advantage of organized competitive sports. (B)  The earlier children take part in sports activities, the better they are. (C)  Encouraging their children to join in sports instead of pushing them (D)  \"Forcing children to take part in sports activities if they dont want to.\"",

Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully.\nBut guess what? All of these things are likely to change in the not-so-distant future. It may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things.\nAirbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed crashes, they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer.\nBetter than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place?

Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\" \n Question: According to the researchers, jackdaws can notice human eye orientation probably because   _  . \n Options: (A) like humans, they also use eyes to communicate (B)  they are far more intelligent than other birds (C)  they are mostly hand-raised by humans (D)  their eyes also have a dark pupil",

It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed.

These fatal fires are often caused by such careless acts as throwing away a lighted match or cigarette, allowing rubbish to pile up, overloading electrical wires, or misuse of healing and cooking equipment.\nFew families go to bed at night without first checking to make sure that the doors and windows are locked, but they overlook a very basic fire safety rule. This rule states that people should sleep with their bedroom doors closed. Nighttime fires are most serious because the family is asleep and the discovery of fire is usually too late.\nA closed bedroom door gives extra protected by delaying the gases and fire, thus giving the family a few minutes to escape.\nAt the first sight of fire in a home, it is necessary for everyone to get out of the house, especially children and elderly persons who may need help. Not everyone flees quickly from a burning home. Children often panic and hide in closets or under beds. Being prepared or knowing what to do in case fire breaks out can mean the difference between life and death. All members of the family should know certain basic steps.\nEveryone should know an escape route and second route from each room in the house. Very young children and old persons should receive careful thought when mapping out family escape plans. Both groups will need special help in escaping from home fires. A family should determine a way in which any members can sound an alarm. It is likely that fire may block hallways and prevent a person from reaching other bedrooms : Family members should be taught not to waste time getting dressed or collecting valuable possessions. Speed is necessary in escaping from fire. \n Question: During a fire children often_. \n Options: (A) panic (B)  jump from windows (C)  cry (D)  know certain steps",

Supported by the Ladies' Association in London for the promotion of female education in India and the East, she immediately took up the work of starting a girls' school for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the opening of a boys' school.\nMrs. Gutzlaff's comprador  happened to come from my village and was actually my father's friend and neighbor. It was through him that my parents heard about Mrs. Gutzlaff's school and it was doubtlessly through his influence and means that my father got me admitted into the school. It has always been a mystery to me why my parents should put me into a foreign school, instead of a traditional Confucian school, where my big brother was placed. Most certainly such a step would have been more suitable for Chinese public opinion, taste, and the wants of the country, than to allow me to attend an English school. Moreover, a Chinese belief is the only avenue in China that leads to political promotion, influence, power and wealth. I can only guess that as foreign communication with China was just beginning to grow, my parents hoped that it might be worthwhile to put one of their sons to learning English. In this way he might become an interpreter and have a more advantageous position to enter the business and diplomatic world. I am wondering if that influenced my parents to put me into Mrs. Gutzlaff's School. As to what other _ it has eventually brought about in my later life, they were entirely left in the hands of God. \n Question: What did the author think of his parents' decision to put him into an English school? \n Options: (A) It was skeptical.

They work not only inside a laboratory, but also out in the field. Fieldwork includes traveling to rivers, oceans and lakes in order to collect information and specimens. Reading, writing and speaking are also very important to the job. Fish scientists need to read the research of other scientists. They must be able to write up their own research clearly so that others can follow it. They also need to be able to give lectures about their findings, so that they can spread knowledge.\nIchthyologists who wish to specialize can choose any one of three areas of study. The first area is aquaculture. This involves the study and practice of fish farming and management. Because it is a rather new study, there are very few job opportunities available. However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own. You also need to be able to handle equipment and perform experiments; but most importantly, you must love fish. To become an ichthyologist, you will need to train at a university to pass a Bachelor of Science degree. For this, you will need to be good at mathematics, physical science and biology. Then, you will need to study for another year to complete an honors degree in ichthyology. This honors degree contains coursework about all aspects of fish. You also need to complete a research paper. \n Question: Who is most likely to become an ichthyologist? \n Options: (A) Tom, because he likes fishing and outdoor sports. (B)  Jack, because he likes to travel and read adventure books. (C)  Jenny, because she likes science, mathematics and reading about dinosaurs. (D)  Jane, because she likes mathematics, science, biology and searching rock-pools.",

            "input": "Article: The majority of physicists once believed that the universe's expansion was slowing down. In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess. \n Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? \n Options: (A) Dark energy has a positive pressure because of its surroundings. (B)  Three fourths of the universe is made up of dark energy. (C)  We have changed our understanding of the universe. (D)  Dark energy has been discovered.",
