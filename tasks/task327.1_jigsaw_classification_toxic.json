    "Definition": "In this task, you get a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to divide the comment into two classes: toxic and non-toxic. Toxicity is dismissed as anything that is rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable that would make someone leave a conversation.",

Although phonetically the Hawaiian language was still the same, a relationship was established between the English and Hawaiian language, for the ultimate purpose of indoctrinating the Hawaiian people into Western schools of thought.\"  \n\nWhat he failed to mention is that the absence of a written language and its importance in recording historical events lead to willy-nilly historical revisionism based on political point of view and wishful thinking. In the present, the \"loudest voice in the room prevails\" type of leadership can still be seen in community meetings here in Hawaii.\n\nIt is of little consequence (other than in commerce and government) what language is spoken, as long as it has a foundation in the written word.  Political discussions are meaningless if there is no basis in writing to accurately judge what has happened in the past.",

Head Start is a program of the U.S..Dept of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families.  Eligibility is largely income-based, although each local program includes other eligibility criteria, such as disabilities and services needed by other family members. Families must earn less than 100% of the federal poverty level.\n\nIn overall,  the study says it doesn't matter if you went to preschool or not.  Most of the children by the 3rd grade showed no significant positive impacts on math skills, prewriting, promotion, or teachers' reports of children's school accomplishments.  \n\nBottom line,  If you want your children to do good in school,  parent involvement is important.",

In a nutshell, this is our own particular society crept up on Utopia's Horizon: Think deep and you will realize that relatively-free & intelligent mankind had only one destination - a society where all menial labor (even Dr.s / lawyers) is executed by artificial-lifeforms. I've never been a fan of or watched Star-Trek, but their look-ahead in many aspects is dead-on. IBM was able to manipulate single atoms and arrange them to their will 20 yrs ago; Crick & Watson have their names on the DNA assembly gear; the need for human-driven-labor diminishes at an exponential rate, and that IS and has always been the unconscious if not conscious goal of technical progress. Food is not much more than novel combinations of atoms and it's totally plausible in the next 100yrs to have Food-Generators basically 3D-printing food. We are getting closer to one facet of an utopian ideal, now we just have to somehow gently convince people that the earth can only support -X- number of occupants...",

Thermal solar can store heat during the day for use at night or on a cloudy day.\nHydrogen in various forms is a very likely major storage mechanism.\nModifications to the current grid structure will make it more robust and solve many problems that current structure imposes. Use of minigrids and UHVDC grid structureneeds to be given thought.",

Properties and stocks subject to capital gains can be bequeathed without the estate paying the outstanding tax  increased value, and the the deemed purchase value of these properties/stocks in the hands of  beneficiaries is reset to current market value. Is that correct?\n\nIn Canada we have never had an estate tax, and we have a simple rule that ensures all taxes on income earned while alive is paid--at death, anything subject to capital gains is deemed to have been sold on the day of death, the the deceased's terminal tax return (not the estate return) is taxed on the gains from those deemed sales.",

Without a doubt, there is a serious problem when people see their premiums soar out of sight, but they were headed that way under the old pre-ACA system. The graphs prepared by the health care economists in our company in the Bush years were absolutely frightening, partly due to the boomer tsunami and the costs of miracle medical care, such as saving preemies at 20 weeks gestation, which were not possible only a decade ago.",

By arriving first the Democratic Syrian forces with assistance from the US, CAnada,\nthe Saudis etc will be the victors who can decide on the future of Raqqa.  The aim is to secure it\nfor the West.  These are long and ugly wars.  Civilians will suffer.  Human Rights' Watch or not.",

Our Founders rightly distrusted government deeply ... with a few exceptions. Alexander Hamilton wanted a king. He thought monarchy was a more efficient form of government, so he made sure the presidency had a lot more power than most of the Founders were comfortable giving to a single \"ruler\".\n\nFor about 100 years, we have been force fed this nonsense that government is supposed to be efficient and pass laws, but that's just meant that we're all drowning in laws to where our society can't function anymore.

But a President Trump will lead to only one (maybe both) of two things.  \n\nOne is complete deadlock, as a majority of both houses of Congress refuse to support his outlandish policies, and as executive agencies quietly put sand in their gears to prevent Trumpish orders from destroying the work of decades.  (Anybody who thinks that the president only has to give an order and it happens has never worked in government.  It's ludicrously easy for bureaucrats to gum up what they don't like.)  \n\nThe other is wreckage.  Declaring a trade war on China is possibly the stupidest idea ever offered by any American in a position to become president.  His ideas on immigration are in the same league.  Voting for this demagogue simply because you hate Hillary is like shooting yourself to teach the world a lesson.",

Social justice entered the art vocabulary, especially in Italian art. Fascism was a direct response to the power of Socialism in Italy back in the day. In Hawaii, we are much more attuned to socialism due to our close relationship with China. The piece illustrated is one of those social justice pieces. Pistoletto has other sculpture much more in tune with classical vibes. Italian art is among the greatest on Earth, for all times. It rivals the French art we are most familiar with and the New York art post world war two that became American art. We are lucky to have this kind of sophistication arriving on our distant shores. It matches the sophistication of the new director of the museum started by the Cookes, who were very tuned in to, say, the Hans Hoffman generation.",

I'm posting from a province where most of the land is privately owned and stumpage is sold at market rates which are several times higher than the BC crown rate creating a situation that  adversely affects local (Canadian) mills that have to pay full market prices for raw material. \nThis festering dispute remains to be settled.",

In an independent study commissioned by the National Gun Victims Action Council, researchers put 77 participants with varying levels of firearms training through three realistic self-defense scenarios. In the first, seven of the participants shot an innocent bystander. Almost all of the participants in the first and second scenarios who engaged the “bad guy” were killed. And in the final scenario, 23% of the participants fired at a suspect who didn’t actually pose a threat.\n\nOverwhelming empirical evidence corroborates the simulation. Of the 160 active shooting incidents identified by the FBI from 2000 to 2013, only one was stopped by an armed civilian. In comparison, two were stopped by off-duty police, four by armed guards and 21 by unarmed civilians.\n\n—Armed With Reason",

As to studs causing ruts in the road?  It is during the summer when ruts are formed.   Heavily-loaded tires on hot, soft asphalt cause them.  In the winter, studs just scratch the road surface when folks stop and go at intersections.  If AKDOT had mandated the use of these plastic compounds in our roads it would have increased the cost of roads by 10%, but.. they would've lasted much, much longer. With fewer ruts.  Canada switched over to polymer-modified asphalts for that very reason and they've had great success.  Sounds like a safety issue, Senator.  The revenue you bring in isn't worth a single life.

Given the 18 month wait for hip replacement surgery, you have to wonder why , for example, in BC, newly-trained orthopedic surgeons cannot find a job. There's more than enough work.\nWhat there isn't enough of is OR time - because health authorities are strapped for cash constantly by the provincial government.  What about the $2 billion surplus that the Liberals were bragging about before their election debacle? What will they do with all those fiscally responsible savings? They won't address the health or education problems - that you can be sure of.

That`s how I took it.  Certainly warrants some more answers, which I imagine will come from the next committee or the floor come amendment time. But I could have missed a step in his testimony too.  I thought the corpus was protected by the earnings reserve =four times the draw, that could be used in times where we needed money or say a capital project.

But we've been here before with leaders who don't practice what they preach (screech) and yet we vote them back in! The GOP blew it on terrorist attacks because they didn't want to make it an issue so soon after the election...they had taxes to cut in payment for wealthy support. And again deregulation, and here both parties are to blame, bit us in the ass, again, and again. Moving jobs overseas is legal and we give tax breaks...why?

In truth, it's really not a status quo at all: it's simply an ongoing process of milking a population, and then moving on as that original population begins to ask the right questions.

The amount of crap I took from teachers and/or administrators because I am not Christian was pretty damn frustrating.  That crap was everything from being sent to detention for not wanting to sing Christmas songs praising Jesus as a part of a required Christmas pageant, to being told pointedly that I would fail a class if I missed a day for the Jewish High Holidays.  Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

Why is it not possible for them to use the forests they already have? Because they can't and remain profitable at the same time. Second, Why are sensitive species that require high quality forest like Woodland Caribou and Spotted Owl now threatened? Third - forestry companies are subsidized because they don't pay very much for the use of the land -- far less than if they owned it. Taxpayers pay for this.

They are now blocked from being DH.\n\nRogers may be happy with lowering payroll costs by not bringing back JB & EE.

Drumpf lied cruelly to them about how he plans to do that.  He can’t bring back the coal miners jobs.  Obama didn’t kill those.  They were killed by LNG and by the declining price of wind and solar energy.  Drumpf cannot bring back the manufacturing jobs.  Even if he were to tear-up free trade agreements and slap tariffs on  products from China (and I’m not holding my breath waiting for that to happen), manufacturing jobs are going to continue to be displaced by robotics and automation.

This article is pure conjecture with no substance. Do your homework, Shapiro, and give us some facts to back up your conclusion that the governor is a poor leader. And to be fair, balance it with an objective review of what he's done and is trying to do for public education. I didn't vote for Governor Ige, but I like the refreshing intelligence, foresight, and direction that he brings to the office. Rather than charisma, we need a leader with a good and balanced head, and this Governor seems to fit the bill. Most if not all the problems you mention have been with us for decades. To blame the current governor for all these problems that he's inherited is ridiculous. He didn't select the Lt. Governor, who is obviously not in tune with him. He didn't invent this system for electing the second in command. You're aiming your venom at the wrong target.",

Why the experts have been wrong:  Experts tried to give several reasons for the impending doom (high debt to income ratio, the previous 2008 crash in the US as an example, etc) whilst ignoring the most basic concept of economics.  There is a pitiful lack of housing supply with respect to surging population growth in YVR and increasing foreign investors.  The city is acting (reacting i should say) now to build but it is late.  Supply will catch up eventually but not for at least 10 years.\n\nI will give you warning signs for a possible bubble burst.  These 3 steps must occur in sequence in order for a burst to occur.",

A worker who's a decade from retirement has ten years of productivity available to his employer and likely a strong work ethic.  The public funds expended to provide public assistance and subsidized health care at least cancel out the cost of the retraining.  Especially if you count the fact that a working person pays taxes that help pay for all those services to youth just preparing for the workforce.  \n\nBut what pains me is that the author's cavalier attitude toward older workers allowed her to gloss over the fact that age discrimination is rampant in this country.

You're right it seems obscene that a coach makes a salary equal to the combined salaries of thirty professors.  But, in today's world of \"big time\" college athletics, that's the way thing are.

This spills over into Begich as well, and I'm consistently amazed by the number of community kids running on the track or playing basketball on evenings and weekends, just enjoying the outdoors and doing their thing.  Having lived in the lower 48 I thought I could spot Section 8 housing from a mile away, but I was surprised when I learned GC is a low/mixed income development.

You as the consumer now do not get what you paid for. \n\nConsidering Comcast owns NBC Universal, they have tons of content that they can favor which stifles their competition and only gives you that promised speed IF you use Comcast's content.",

To be honest, sometimes the people who profess to hate hate come off as the biggest haters of all.\n\nWith the (unfortunately) likely loss by Bernie Sanders in the still-to-be-decided Democratic primary, Donald Trump is the only outsider candidate. I think it's quite clear that Americans want change, we want an outsider, we want someone who will challenge the status quo.
