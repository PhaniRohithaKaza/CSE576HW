Fewer calls for service means officer's have more time for proactive patrols. Less crime means less arrests. The \"broken windows\" theory has some truth to it, but it's more than just property upkeep. It's also taking smaller crimes, including quality of life issues seriously.

Traffic enforcement is part of it, but not just during \"peak\" times. Criminals figure that out and work it to their advantage. It's using all the tools together to find the best solution.

Ontario pays $500 in taxes given the larger population, however, it receives $550 back in transfers as a have not province and a net benefactor of equalization. So who paid more in taxes? We pay taxes to the fed and the fed sends transfers back to the provinces. If you receive more in transfers than you’ve paid in (as is the case with all have not provinces), by definition, you’ve paid less tax on a net basis than a have province. Equalization forces you to look at everything on a net basis. Net of transfer payments, Ontario does not pay the largest portion of federal taxes.

Josh Fox knew this and blatantly lied about it in his documentary. The origin of the gas can be proven by determining the type of gas coming out of the faucet. In a CSU study done in Weld County (shown to have flaming tap water in the documentary), gas in water wells has been shown to be biogenic in origin 98% of the time meaning it could not have originated in an oil and gas bearing formation (where thermogenic gas originates from). Rather, it is the result of microbial processes much more shallow than oil and gas and coincidentally right near our aquifers.

They are living in a Christian way. Their life has changed. The logical error made by the critics of AL is to understand \"living as brother and sister\" in a merely external sense. It means not having sex, nothing more and nothing less. This is rigorism, but it is also laxism. In every rigorism there is a corresponding occult laxism.

That's not ridiculous, its how the country was designed.\n\nAll this shows is 1) how ridiculous 2 electors can be when they try to negate the will of the voters in their state because they can't accept the result of the election (decision of voters) in other states and 2) we have provisions in this state to counteract faithless electors and protect the decision of voters. \n\nBecause you are correct - we don't elect these folks to be mavericks.

The privately owned ones are more available and offer quicker service. In either case the government pays the full cost. The private clinics are very modest looking establishments - no frills. The private clinic simply sends the bill to the government. There is no \"two tier\" - the wealthy get the same service as the poor. I think this same model would work for all kinds of other services  - scans, surgeries or whatever. As a patient, I win because I didn't have to wait. Government wins because I am more likely to stay healthy if I access care in a timely fashion. In this case at least, competition works. The unionized clinics run by hospitals will simply not be used as much because the private service es are equal and quicker.",

At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner. \n\nOn average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

Many of our residents are grateful for the civil rights protections afforded them as US citizens.  Nonetheless, the USA should provide reparations for overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy and seizing its lands.  What to do?  The only viable option I can think of is for the US Government to acquire Niihau through eminent domain, and then turn it over to the Hawaiian Nation as a place to exist on their own, without US control.

Take the Vancouver area:  in the mid 1950's mortgage rates were low,around 4%, and a typical house sold for maybe $10,000.  By 1981, inflation in Canada was getting out of control, peaking at roughly 13%, with mortgages at 14% or 15%.  Despite that, houses had risen to sell for typically $200,000 to $300,000.  That is not a doubling in a decade - it is a 20 fold to 30 fold increase in 25 years!   So much for high interest rates killing any appreciation.  All  before foreign buyers.  Of course houses have gone up  roughly another 5 fold to 10 fold since then as rates came back down these past 35 years.  Moral of the story is that real estate  appreciated  more in a rising wage/rising mortgage rate environment  than it did in a tepid wage increase/mortgage rates decreasing one.",

Even if I want to throw a letter to the editor/this newspaper across the room at times, I never felt that the editors allowed something that crossed a line...so, that's where I draw the line. I trust the RG editors in figuring it out. This isn't a big city with a big newspaper.  I'm okay with the letters.\nMy concern is the free-for-all online comments area where lines have been crossed and would never see the light of day in the editor's mailbag or as a guest view point.

He will be impeachable from Day 1 -- but I doubt that he'll be impeached.  The process requires integrity in the Congress, especially in the members of the president's own party. It was the integrity of the Republicans in Congress that brought Nixon down.  I don't see anything remotely close to that courage or integrity in this Republican Congress.\nHowever, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump quits at about the halfway mark.

Dark wood, shelves lined with books, lamps and mirrors placed just so.  And if I had a question about a piece, she usually had the answer I was looking for.  She was generous with her time and often offered me insights into the things I wanted to buy.  She was kind and patient.

I think this new staff is very capable of doing more with what they have, but as we have seen, all it takes is a few key errors on the part of a staff to turn a good team into a poor team. Taggart should be prepared to upgrade his staff every chance he gets if any of them fail to produce, or even if he can get someone better. The same meritocracy of competition he preaches to his players should also apply to his staff. A staff that does not advance their team each year is a staff with a team in decline.

I'm torn ... if some addict pulled a knife or gun on me, demanding money or valuables, I wouldn't hesitate to cap them on the spot, and feel no guilt.

But really, the TRUE purpose of this is simple: to scare judges into convicting people more often in sex assault cases. That is what this \"education\" is about. Same with the provisions designed to name and sham judges who haven't been \"trained\" in sexual assault (why isn't special training required for murder, aggravated assault, financial crimes, or any of the other 500-or-so Criminal Code offences, or any other aspect of financial law, family law, tax, securities, tort, business, immigration, child protection.......?). \n\nThat is the purpose, to make judges fearful of the professional consequences of acquitting people.",

I continue to “hear”  them up and down Waialae (fill in the blank of your street) and observe many that do not have a moped license.

Mexico should be prosperous.  It has all the necessary ingredients for a sound economy.   Yet it remains a place that people are trying to leave.  The Church does have a role here.  It can let the Mexican Elite know that it is past time for them to release their control and democratize Mexico.

The greatest correlation between a vote for trump and trump voter's attributes was lack of education.  Not income, not race, not gender, not age.  So, for stupid white guys like you who love the baby-in-chief, it's time to own your racism, homophobia, and misogyny that are all tied to your lack of education and your willful stupidity. But please keep posting so I continue to have a chance to point out your stupidity.",

After all, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Oregon’s cattle and calf production grew 70% from 2005’s $525 Million to $894 Million in 2015. In that same period, ranchers increased the dollar value of livestock used for home consumption from $17 Million to $19 Million (in business, that’s called “eating the profits”). Maybe it’s not the wolves eating the herds, after all.\n\nOregon cattle losses went from 65,000 in 2005 to 61,000 in 2015.

No.  \n\nSo with almost $10 billion dollars of oil being taken from Alaska per year, tax- free, they ignore that, and focus on a raid on the Dividend that will truly harm the Alaska economy.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting.",

It's a kind of bizarre claim that the the rule is true BECAUSE there are exceptions to it.\n\nWords change their meanings over time - and if you don't know the current meaning, you cannot communicate honestly, logically or usefully.",

No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality.” But he has plenty of company.

I would choose an urgent care centre over a walk-in clinic every time.

The hospitals already have the skills in place to effectively administer these facilities.  That would allow us to move away from the bill for service model and go to an employee/employer model.

So the picture is crimes are dropping in frequency, and a variety of crimes fit this trend, including sexual assaults. And this would not be surprising, as Canada is an aging population, with fewer males in their teens, 20s and 30s, when most violent crimes are performed (males are more often perpetrators of violent crimes).\n\nBut with the second method, self-reporting in a poll, the exact same rates of self-reported sexual assault have stayed constant and not budged at all.\n\nGiven that MASSIVE gulf in alignment, it is strange that the reporter selects only quotes from people convinced that the second method perfectly reflects truth.",

In regards to liability, the government is immune from any save for proximate causation which isn't really an argument here. You may be thinking of the Dylan Roof case - where his pending charges in state court should have shown up on his attempt to purchase the firearm that he used, but that one also slipped through the cracks. As a responsible multiple-gun owner myself, it's very sad and very frustrating to see the government fail in its own obligation to not allow prohibited people purchase firearms.

The Democrats have sort of morphed (and I hope I am wrong) into a sort of elite liberal intelligentsia with no \"boots on the ground\" (so to speak). By this I mean that the Bernieites who sold us old dems down the river ala the Ralph Nader experience (did they learn nothing in school about recent presidential third party failures and the mess which is left over?) in the last election seem to have it too easy. I fear for our country because the political/social/economic polarization has gotten extreme, and the 1 percenters are really screwing ALL of us. Thanks for trying to explain elements of this mess.",

In fact, Monticello was built in 1772, before there was a Declaration of Independence, Constitution or United States.  And, the heroes of the revolution did not fight to specifically to preserve the rights to own others.

The ordinance governing initiatives allows the county council to adopt the ones that obviously have overwhelming popular support.  This is because we live in a representative democracy and most laws are written and enacted by our elected officials.  It is, in fact, unusual for a new law to be put directly to the people for a vote and should only be done in cases where the elected officials feel they for some reason cannot support making the law themselves.

This sexual licentiousness occurred concurrently with a rising crisis of confidence among all clergy …\nThe atmosphere of disciplinary and doctrinal defiance common to the time [60's & 70's] would have encouraged confusion among the rank and file priests, and in the deviant, set sexual behaviour afoot ...”\n\nhttp://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2265&context=lnq",

This practice created a disincentive for people to start small businesses because they would have to enter a non-pooled insurance group and pay much more.  It also makes it more difficult for employees to switch jobs or leave the workforce to take care of their children.  Last, the businesses essentially paid for catastrophic care for everyone.  People without insurance did not pay their medical bills when a major accident or illness occurred, but hospitals still had to receive those patients.  Those costs were shifted to those that paid, the people insured by their workplace.  Just tax us all the same and make an even playing field with a single payer system.",

The racial undertones to which the Hawaii State Inmates are being subjected to  are as cruel and real as any slavery and/or Civil Rights movement. Yet, as a proud African-American I personally intervened at every possible opportunity, and tried to get all the Inmates to understand what was happening to them by the Saguaro Warden, Todd Thomas. I used the assistance of my auntie Kat Brady, to try to get most of the Inmates help, and Kat Brady did her best in that regard.

Unfortunately many women have to deal with a wide variety and level of unwanted physical behavior.  Someone like Taylor Swift is probably often faced with a question of whether or not to make a big deal of inappropriate behavior right at that instant or at a better time for her.  Her bodyguard would not have let someone do her serious physical harm, but he stood up and correctly took his cues from her on what to do with an obnoxious abusive scumbag.  She chose to wait until just after the event to deal with it, which was one of many totally appropriate ways to handle it.",

Every time Trump speaks, he addresses the issue of finding American well paying jobs. This means a lot to those of us who live in the Rust Belt. We might have voted for Obama, but this time, we voted for Trump. He understands our pain and perhaps so do the Catholic bishops. I would consider that to be a good thing. Not every Catholic voter is obsessed with social issues. When you get right down to it, we want to support our families and we want to live in security. Obama did not help us; he did everything to prevent us from losing our jobs except give us more hand outs. We don't want hand outs. We want to work.",

Our legal system is based on precedence. If a parent can be accountable for this, then it would be equally true that they are accountable for their taxes, their tickets, their bills, and all other crimes. Children are their own actors. They choose to follow or not follow guidance. Even if there is a lack of guidance, the virtues of right and wrong are virtually universal at a very young age. \n\nYou can't be held accountable for someone elses actions unless you were knowingly involved in the events of the crime.",

The first cop killing I covered as a young reporter in San Bernardino, Calif.,  involved an “unarmed” black man who wrestled a white cop’s gun from him and shot him dead.\n\nHow many times have Brown and Martin been referred to as “unarmed?” Being unarmed does not make a person harmless.",

If a person is not motivated to take the simple steps needed to register as a voter on their own, they are far less likely to vote, even when our state makes that so easy with mail-in ballots. In states that still require voters to go to the polls, these folks would be even less likely to make the effort to vote.\n\nWhen Republicans who want to require voter ID to avoid potential voting fraud are accused of suppressing minority voters, I don't believe it. Registering and voting requires only a minor effort, but  if a person doesn't care enough to do the first, they probably aren't going to care enough to do the second. The arguments for why anyone can't do these simple things are just silly, and according to some blacks, racist.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBxZGWCdgs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1h3UJxOBBI",

You are ridiculost and always looking for an excuse to attack the democratic left while you, like your illegitimate President tRump, support the KKK, white supremacists and Nazi's in your midst.

Please keep those of us in mind who would either lose healthcare insurance, or who would have to pay more for less, each time you vote on a healthcare bill!",

There are many injustices in this country but we must work together to rectify them. If you go anywhere else in this world those same injustices are exponentially worse. When will these protests end?  During WWII, America had internment camps. Should I start waiting for the Asian American protests?  Currently in this country our Muslim population is being vilified and judged. When will the Muslim American contingent start dishonoring our flag? This countries Latino population, I feel, is by far the most persecuted and judged. Where is their voice?

By contrast, against Macron, polls show she is trailing by 20 points which is far greater than Brexit or Trump were trailing.

Eventually you have to throw more and more stimulus to achieve the same growth.\n\nKeynes also showed that the stimulatory effects decline to zero as Government spending approaches 20% of GDP. We are well above that now.\n\nSince the increase in deficit has gone primarily to program spending, not Infrastructure spending, Keynes would be spinning in his grave.",

All three conditions are well documented for men and women deacons; as well of course as male priests and male bishops. \n\nSecond, Macy has recently reported that there is evidence of female deacons in the West in the 12th century, somewhere in northern Europe. I do not have the citation for this, as I only heard him report this orally about six months ago at a conference on the female diaconate in Toronto, and I don't recall whether it had been published by then. \n(continued)",

The real problem is judges who are too timid to take authoritative control of the proceedings in their court rooms and allow matters to be dragged out, thereby soaking up what resources are available.  There are numerous manifestations of this.  Some examples:\n\n- a court date is set for the purpose of fixing yet another court date (e.g. for a sentencing hearing).\n- defence counsel are allowed to go on open-ended fishing expeditions without laying any reasonable foundation for same.\n- police making last minute disclosures of evidence (don't grant an adjournment - that only encourages them - just exclude it unless it is exculpatory).\n- Crown Counsel being ill-prepared (cf.
