Even the conservative congregations which flew off in a huff and aligned themselves with homophobic African bishops have come crawling back once they realized, in court, that their respective dioceses owned their pretty traditional buildings under AEC Canon Law. Apparently they didn't want to go through the heavy lifting required to replace those pretty buildings, so their righteous outrage over the \"scandal\" of the gay bishops took a back seat as they quietly dropped their lawsuits. The Methodists will get past this issue as well - long after most of the gay people have disappeared from the pews after having been driven away by homophobic sermons and condescending looks. In most churches the only gay people still around are the closeted, or in this case not-so-closeted clergy. These days most gay people would rather sleep in on Sundays.",

It has nothing to do with which individuals may be married in the first place.\n\nIt's likely that the historical Jesus may have thought as little of same-sex relationships as did his Jewish contemporaries. But we don't know that, and he surprises us with other counter-cultural innovations.

We can have the best drivers on the road but accidents happen if anyone has a momentary lapse in judgment, which can be fatal to anyone not in a car.  The car will always win so who's fault it is doesn't matter in the end.  An education campaign should focus on pedestrian and cyclist safety.  Back to basics of \"Look both ways before you cross\", which no one seems to do anymore, would be a great start for all.

There seem to be no more 'gentlemen' - just men who want to use you and be loved and appreciated because they are men. This includes engaging in mean and selfish behaviour, substance abuse and blaming of others without examining their own actions. You have to dose yourself with birth control to avoid getting pregnant with a partner who you aren't sure you could rely on to be there for you if you did, even though you have been together for years. And then you break up and they are off to find another woman who will put up with the poor treatment. However, rather than the transactional kind of male/female relationship that Wente describes where women offer up sex in exchange for material security, I have always dreamt of a deep friendship and love in a romantic relationship, where there are shared interests and a simple enjoyment of being together. I've found this with a woman - but not a man.",

It is the electro/spiritual energy that guides its action and could not have been present in the undifferentiated phase, but must be present when developoment is guided by the brain and nervous system from gastrulation on. Of course, this has nothing at all to do with whether first trimester abortion can be regulated by treating these embryos as legal persons, because of the problem of miscarriage and making it a public matter. It stays private and the rest of abortions that occur are too few to worry about and are often medically neccessary.",

Science is the only objective method available to us to attain knowledge, to learn and to discover and to make predictions.  None of what is written about Jesus were written by Jesus, his apostles or anyone who witnessed anything of Him.  We simple do not know with certainty...we have oral tradition which extends over vast time periods from many people over and over and has less veracity than hearsay.  In regard to the Trinity;  if science does not know it, no one does, no other source has an objective method to determine it.  There is nothing objective about church apologetic and catechesis.

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say \"Islam\" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.  Plus, where are they when these things happen?  I rarely see any news stories of large swaths of muslim sincerely renouncing these atrocities nor do I see them doing something about it day to day.

Israel has has fought battle with Syria itself and I fear it may dip its wick in that disaster-zone again. And don't forget the Russians. Dirty, corrupt  Russians.

I didn't give another thought to the EC until 2000 when we dodged the bullet of having Al Core the idiot as president. I wasn't a Trump supporter and I still have deep reservations about him, but I am a fan of the Constitution and so, I accept the election results and think those who want to change it are only saying that now because their party lost. If Hillary Clinton had lost the popular election, but won all but 18 of the state-popular votes, they'd be singing a different tune right now.

Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2.

As the coordinator and other senior faculty retired they were not replaced, but at every meeting now there are these people attending who have no technical back-ground but with big name positions (Chairs, Program Managers, Deans, Associate Deans, Vice-Presidents, etc., etc.).  Now they hire mostly part-time instructors but it seems as if it is never the same person twice because the turnover is so high.  The students complain, the shops and labs are becoming a shambles of old junky equipment, and the quality of the graduates has fallen.

As I recall there was a comparison done that showed that Montreal built 10,000 new purpose built rental units in one particular year and Toronto built about 300.  The 1991 exemption was an attempt to induce builders to re-start the construction of rental units.  Essentially the government gave their word that these units would never be subject to rent control.  Ms Wynne has just broken that moral contract and in fact may have broken a legal contract.

This is lower or comparable to RF exposures from radio or television broadcast transmitters.</i>\n\nAs noted, it's about the frequency and the strength of the signal. The strength drops off quickly with distance. So if you don't suffer symptoms from TV signals, then you cannot suffer symptoms from a typical base tower.\n\nhttp://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs304/en/",

The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

I think not. But, by the time I was so diagnosed, I would be likely legally incapacitated from making a choice.\n\nDuring my many campaigns, I knocked at thousands of doors and sometimes met spouses who were giving care to their Alzheimer's stricken spouses at great personal emotional cost. It made me question what I would want to do if I were so stricken. \n\nThat has promoted my wife and I to execute \"living wills\" to try to answer as many questions as we can.

That could mean a lot of things. When was the building constructed? If it's old enough, it would need earthquake retrofitting. What about asbestos? Same thing. How big is the building? Is it ONLY holding 20 apartments, or does it have ground floor offices, other offices, rental space, storage? Was it fitted with new high-efficiency windows? Doors? Major insulation upgrades? ADA upgrades? Were any of the support columns/beams having to be replaced/upgraded? What about heating systems? New boilers needed? Was the parking lot included? If so, you have to add in new landscaping requirements, drainage, etc.\n\nIt appears the idea is to run it for at least 16 years, so it looks like the building was renovated with that in mind. The price would reflect that. Analysis please?\n\nAnd this looks a far better deal for Anchorage than the Taj Mahawker II!",

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Chances are, you or your daughter wouldn't necessarily know what a \"trans\" looks like. Ironic, how many \"straight\" people are rapists, pedophiles and child molesters. Of all the stories we have seen in the news about peep holes, bathroom recordings or cameras in public bathrooms, I don't recall a single story about a \"trans\" person doing that. You have more to fear from straight people that you ever do w/ LGBT. \"Straight\" females frequently lure other females so their \"straight\" male partners can assault them.

Two different issues to me. It seems that a bunch of white people who don't have friends from other religions or cultures are quick to jump on the perceived \"politically correct\" bandwagon without understanding what the niqab represents. (Reminds me of the stupid naive white non-Muslim Ontario politician that once said we should allow Muslim immigrants to practice sharia law in Canada if they want.)  A hijab (head covering) is not a niqab (face veil) so lumping them together in news reports also does not assist the public discourse.

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

To coin a phrase, what difference does it make?  If abortion does not take the life of an innocent human being, what difference does it make whether women want to choose it or not?\n\nIn short--if I didn't believe that abortion took the life of a human being, I would not care about abortion!\n\nI care about punishing people who murder innocent defenseless human beings.

To make priests sacramental ministers the church would have to admit the capabilities of professional lay people. My experience with that? I'm not working for the diocese anymore. Further, I'm a professional woman. They wanted to do things their way, whether legal or moral or not, against professional advice.

Civil damages, however, have to be established separately in a court of law. Any award for damages would no doubt have been challenged in higher courts by the side  disagreeing with the award, but the courts can take into the potentially deleterious impacts of an award, which in this case would surely include the matter of moral hazard. As any substantial award would have done, the Khadr settlement establishes an incentive for others to take serious risks (i.e. joining terrorist organizations abroad) for which others could incur significant costs.

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Inherited wealth means that soon one's entire destiny is determined by accidents of birth. Rich parents means you will be rich and powerful. Even if you are an idiot. And since you own and control all resources everybody else becomes dependent on your whim. Even politicians are dependent on you - so you end up with two laws. One for the rich and one for the poor. You have an aristocracy.\nThis is not a flaw in libertarianism.

This, IMO, a result of declaring itself \"infallible\" with respect to teachings on faith and morals which, one could argue, intersects all facets of life--including respect for diversity. Instead of apologizing to the various cultures for past transgressions, why not publicly denounce and/or remove the erroneous doctrine? Ah, the woes of creeping infallibility!",

And if courtesy and acknowledging others is a real hardship (I've experienced this too), some of the wisest words I heard in college were from Rusty at LCC who said directly to me (a stranger) \"If something isn't working, maybe I can change myself\". Some might say Rusty is a developmentally challenged individual, but I beg to differ.

Therefore if the ACLU is successful in this case, all someone would have to do when the go to this black baker (just to be evil to him) is order a cake with the Grand Cyclops of the KKK on it...claim they were gay and therefore protected and watch with incredible glee as this black business owner has to submit...under the law...to decorate this Alt-Right guys cake with this heinous image on it. It's a virtual civil rights kick right in the teeth.\nThe Little Guy",

This minority variant is not, of course, lived in a way that is independent of culture, habitat, religion, education and customs. It is lived, as is every other human reality, in an entirely culture-laden way, which is one of the reasons why it has in the past been so easy to mistake it as merely a function of culture, psychology, religion or morality: something to get worked up about rather than something that is just there.\"",

We're calling King's X on it.\"  I also, on this site, criticized Ms. Clinton for her \"deplorable\" comment...so, please don't be so generous with your \"hypocrite\" accusation.  \n\nYou repeatedly contend that anyone who disagrees with you is a) stupid, b) a liar and c) a hypocrite... That pretty well eliminates the possibility that others might just have a perspective which differs from yours.  We all have different life experiences, different backgrounds and different views, and the freedom to express them. It's called democracy.",

They say power corrupts.  So does other people`s money corrupt, more so when your \"rolling in the dough\" as my WWII vet dad would have said.  Neuman expected oil to stay high to buttress his bridge, but it fell from grace like the road to Juneau and McKinnon`s gold mine,.. as fast as the drop in the price of oil led to infinite write-offs (SB21)",

The murder rate was 7.9 per-100,000 people in 1973 also.  \n\nAfter marijuana possession was decriminalized the State murder rate generally fell, except for a spike in 1981, with only five years after 1975 seeing a murder rate above 6.4, with only a single year above 5.9 per-100,000 people after 1986, when Colorado had 2.23 million less people than today.  \n\nIf we will recall, the State had a recession in 1986 after oil prices fell, when our murder rate was last at 7.0, so perhaps the Lakewood Police spokesman is correct in his assertion that an economic downturn has something to do with rising crime rates?  Maybe the rising cost of rent is too high against income growth?  \n\nhttp://www.disastercenter.com/crime/cocrime.htm",

Canada until 50 years ago was almost entirely white, and it takes time to accumulate family wealth, so obviously the majority of families in wealthy neighbourhoods are white. What is actually noteworthy is how rapidly this in changing, for example in Vancouver, where a large percentage of the wealthy are Asian. So talk of knocking down the walls is silly (not to say typical of this columnist). As more non-whites immigrate and some accumulate wealth, the complexion of wealthy neighbourhoods will continue to change. \n\nPrivate schools provide a way to advantage average students, who lack the special qualities that enable more able or socially adept students to succeed in the public system. I think parents understand this, and that is why a great many families with two good incomes, but earning together far less than would put them in the top 1%, send their kids to private schools. In BC, 12% go to these schools.",

First of all undocumented immigrants are criminals, they broke the immigration laws.  Thus use the correct term, \"illegal aliens\". Second Trump executive order is constitutional and has been done and upheld in the past. This has no similarity to what happened in WWII and you are disingenuous to report it.  This was not a Muslim ban, as there are at least 40 other countries with Muslim majorities, inhabited by the 90% of world wide Muslims. These countries were originally cited by Obama.  And what you say about illegal aliens turning in others because they have no fear of being deported is garbage. Prove it .Obama said he would withhold Federal funds for States not following his \"bathroom\" rules. Where was your outcry? It's not racism. its safety.  How many more Americans are you willing to harm by protecting criminal illegal aliens?   Who in your family are you willing to sacrifice?",

The party helped Ms.Clinton cheat Mr. Sanders, going to CNN and receiving the questions to a debate, thus giving her the unfair advantage. Ms. Clinton thus cheated Mr. Sanders, pretty much a fact, but I understand some would like to think it never happened, but sadly she did cheat.\n\n\nIt is all very easily researched, especially in today's age of technology. Look into it a bit. WIKILEAKS, although I don't care for them, revealed so much undesirable elements about the Democratic Party, I felt it was a shame they didn't do so to the Republican Party as well.\n\n\nIf you think Ms. Clinton was the most honest candidate to run, that is your prerogative and right, not going to argue that either, though I strongly disagree looking at her many evidenced lies throughout her history. All are entitled to believe what they desire, like I hear many Dems today would like her to just go away!  \n\nHave a wonderful evening!",

The government just has to *hint* that it might do something, and the media will be in a frenzy to report it. Governments \"leak\" information to media outlets they favour, not to the ones they dislike. Governments give interviews to journalists that give them good coverage, and those that don't are out in the cold.\n\nThe so-called independent media is beholden to the government for its daily bread.

They have had a terrific season and the fact their stating pitching staff is almost all rookies and has done very well says a lot about the future of this team. I always felt they needed to develope their own pitchers and get the kids used to pitching in a higher altitude at Co Springs instead of investing too much in high priced free agents who might be a bit intimidated at pitching in Denver. And the Rox have the perfect manger for this young staff in Black. They should overtake the D-Backs for the number one WC spot, and gain home field for the play-in game. GOOD LUCK!",

They feel disenfranchised and outside society.

The reason to gut the current system is that it puts far too much risk from market swings in price on the state and its people.  The oil industry itself is far better placed to grasp and manage market risk.  IF we want to subsidize energy prices, WE can cut checks (say) to Southcentral gas users when the cost of gas goes up - IF we can afford to.  Otherwise, the market will determine the price and consumers may consume without regard to it, may conserve to reduce their bills, or may switch to alternative sources of energy for the same reason.  We could also buy the gas fields and not make as large a profit as oil companies do.  There is NO reason to be subsidizing oil companies, UNLESS some specific benefit (e.g. development) is obtained by so doing.",

It was really a lawless and dangerous time in American history for the average citizen, especially if you lived in the or near the South. The country was far more divided than now, so much so that a section of it wanted to break away and form their own country and did more than talk about it, they actually tried to. Gangs of murdering thugs roamed the countryside pillaging and killing. Google \"Lawrence, Kansas\" for one example during that period in the late 1850's.

King James author of the Bible also has a book called Sorceress. Only 9 million women in Europe alone were burnt for the fun of evil Bible bashers and their sick cult which happens to be the same as Mithra and Dionysus. Americans are very nice, they allow men to marry men and adopt children, the church has openly told the UN they wont hand in pedophiles. The only Western country where drugs kill more than alcohol. Even without Muslims they only have 4 rapes a minute and a murder every 15 minutes. The cream is Americans are so indoctrinated they don't care for their own problems but watch the media becoming the obese people in the world and think they care more for others than themselves.",

Therefore, we are responsible when someone is executed and when someone who should have been executed kills again.  Note that putting someone in a cage for the rest of their life is seen as just another form of capital punishment by both the system and those in it.  Given the choice, most chose death to that terrible alternative.  Whether someone should die is not a matter of justice or the offensiveness of the crime, but of danger.  Non-dangerous people should be rehabilitated and released.  Truly dangerous people who cannot be helped must be kept from harming others, which means euthanasia - not as an execution event, but as a simple medical necessity.",

The Quran is read by too many Muslims to sanction the killing of infidels, simply because they are infidels.  There you have the making of another American disaster.  Now, if the chances of terrorists' entering the country were small, or if the size of the harm they pose were small, there would be a good argument that NO special vetting is needed.  But no other population has, in recent times, had so many practitioners of both frequent and huge-scale violence.  So long as there are so many Muslims committing so many acts of terror in the name of Islam, we are rational in at least taking special care to see that those who come aren't a real risk.",

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

They did not share or seek advice about how to handle complaints; motivated by the fact that they did not want to be seen as the one who brought scandal on the church. That was their primary goal. A contributing factor also was the selection of bishops. Under JPII & BVI; Papal Nuncios were all of a related template. Unfortunately just before BVI resigned, he promoted his long serving personal assistant (10 yrs) at the CDF, Monsignor Charles Brown (U.S.) as Nuncio and personally consecrated him as Archbishop.

Picking winners is easy and that funding is the issue.\n\nThe mathematics of investing are however well understood and unassailable.  \n\nVC investing is lognormally distributed.  This means there are one or two winners, a few that break even and many that are losers.  Activities that are lognornally distributed require a different approach that may sound like heresy to big believers in active management.\n\nThe right way to address VC is:\n\n1.   To screen first for the  basics in terms of a business plan, perceived market, personal integrity, skin in the game etc.\n\n2. Provide a small amount of capital per vetted firm with planned and customized milestones for further allocations.\n\n3. Monitor all funded companies being quick to cut off losers that fail to meet milestones\n\n4. Continue to support winners including using other levers to gain advancement.\n\nIn the end a small number will be profitable and perhaps one can be a national leader.",

In their native countries they would be raped and murdered for not wearing them. Islam as it exists today is a pestilence on humanity. Of course there are many wonderful people who are Muslims. There were a lot of charming German Nazis too. But Muslims belong to a cult whose basic tenant is that anyone who is not Muslim is sub-human and can be enslaved and murdered with impunity. That is a fact. It is a cult which deems women as property belonging to men - first their father and brothers, then their husband. If those men decide the behavior of a woman has dishonored them they are free to murder her. The worst problem with Islam today is that it encourages women to have as many babies as possible.",

The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on LGBT rights-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a \"homosexual lifestyle\".[1]\"  \n\nIMO, the \"real\" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as \"second-class\" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.  I don't feel that goal is unreasonable.  As used by those right-wing Christians it's a epithet designed to force homosexuals \"back into the closet where they belong!!!\"   Gary Crum",

Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.\n\nAnd he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: \"I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough\"\n\nAnd he attacked the USA repeatedly.

At its height, the force was more than 130,000 strong, with troops from 51 NATO and partner nations.A new, smaller non-combat mission (“Resolute Support”) was launched on 1 January 2015 to provide further training, advice and assistance to the Afghan security forces and institutions.\n\nYou can argue it was naive and flawed.  You can argue it failed.  You might even argue that it wasn't needed, that international jehad wasn't a big threat from Afghanistan.

It did with Israel when the Israeli Navy and Air Force tried to sink the USS Liberty before it could report on Israeli orders to solve the problem of too many Egyptian POWs by killing them and burying the bodies in unmarked mass graves.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Liberty_flag_-_National_Cryptologic_Museum_-_DSC07641.JPG\n\nhttps://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/museum/exhibits/#uss_liberty",

I've worked closely to the dairy industry in Canada for the past 20 years and one thing I've learned is that in the absence of some form of production control - dairy farmers in particular will produce far more milk than can be processed/consumed - hence driving down the price of milk to below cost of production (as is the case in the US today).  Do we pay a slightly higher price for dairy products in Canada?  Sometimes - depending on which US state you are living in (anyone bought milk in FLA before???).  If you want rid of supply management in Canada - ok - but don't expect prices in the grocery store to drop and say goodbye to the vibrant economic activity that these farms produce in rural Ontario at least.  Soon we will import 100% of our cars from US/Mexico -might as well import all dairy products too!",

This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.",

Cain was not acting in accordance with God's will, just the opposite. From the very beginning the righteous are persecuted by the wicked.  \n\nGod might have made the world so there would be no wickedness in it.  But man would not be free to pursue the highest good.  The highest good is to obey God and love Him because our desire is for Him.\n\nJesus desired this 'oneness' with God so much He willfully suffered death on the cross, not only so He could enjoy communion with the Father, but He died so we all might enjoy that same communion.\n\nJesus is happy for us that we can walk in the path He walked.  \n\nPaul put it like this: \n\n\"Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ\" Phil. 3:8",

Responsibility for pedestrian safety starts first with drivers, who need to slow down, consciously look for pedestrians, obey the laws and quit rushing.  Second, pedestrians need to be alert, not distracted, and look to make eye contact with nearby drivers of cars.  Banning the use of cellphones while crossing city and state streets would certainly help.  As for intersection design, that is more of a science than an art.  Both the cities and state follow the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), a federal guideline which specifies when certain treatments (such as no turning movements and Barnes Dances) should be used.  Research on Barnes Dances shows they work incredibly well in some locations and horribly in others.  Cities have removed Barnes Dances where the impact on traffic congestion was severe and unjustified by pedestrian counts.   I urge the city to continue its safe pedestrian movement.",

For example- you pointed to Sandy Hook. Was he white- yes. Christian? No... that is equivalent to me saying that a black man shooting someone is a Muslim attack.\nAnd shall we compare death tolls to your examples vs the daily attacks in the name of Islam? While I was writing this post, several people were probably murdered in the name of Islam for offenses such as apostasy or homosexuality. Do yourself a favor and start paying attention to the REAL concern of Islamic terrorism. Also, read the Quran a bit.. then study the history of Muhammed, a man who beheaded many, many people and also married a 6 year old girl. Then ask yourself why you are defending this religion.",

Most high profile mass shootings and terrorist attacks occur in gun free zones for a reason.  These are soft targets with little expected resistance.
