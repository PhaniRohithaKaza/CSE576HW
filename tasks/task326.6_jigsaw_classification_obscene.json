What about that is not \"civil?\" Friends and family of the thief don't like that?  This guy is a LOSER. He is a THIEF. Those are documented facts. He also probably has a long list of other crimes. People don't just go get a gun and decide to pull an armed robbery if they are \"good\" people. They don't choose that as their very first attempt to steal. I'm sick of people not approving comments based on them not liking what is said.

Too bad for those investors... the capitalist pigs.

Upon the completion of the fixed election, rigged by the Russians, Trump unleashes the fossil fuel industry from crippling Obama era regulations, opens up drilling to once closed government properties and permits the construction of the two controversial pipelines. Oil prices drop everywhere. \nRussia's income shrinks. Are they that damn dumb?",

Hey, Dana Altman, you recruited a player who was under investigation for sexual assault at his previous school and then you either lied about knowing this or were incompetent for not knowing. Your pathetic and embarrassing press conference after those three players were kicked out was the epitome of ignorance about the realities of rape and sexual assault that women face. Now you want to play it off as people just didn't believe in you? Go to hell, you selfish bastard! 1 in 4 women will be raped in their lifetimes. 1 in 10 women at the U of O will be raped in their time at university--this is a true horror.

But, at the same time, we'd best make significant strides toward needed long-term adjustments to live with it as best we can.

You can safely assume hundreds of thousands of hours of leave would have to be written off the books with checks, and long-service employees who have climbed the payscale will get large payouts (a quarter million or more for some folks I know who have several thousand hours in the bank).\n\nThe brinksmanship is a bad joke.

Awesome movie, which one did you watch?",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3. Something that trump does in the US will cause a cascade effect at home. I can't claim to know what that would be, because its far too early in his presidency.

As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church.

The administration exercised that legal right and terminated Mr. Walls with no stated \"cause\".....that was perfectly legal...however \"unfair\" it might seem.  On the other hand, perhaps they did have \"cause\" but chose to \"take the easy way out\" and not go through the hassle of proving any justification for his termination.  They experienced considerable \"blowback\" because of their actions and, it seems, decided to \"buy off\" Mr. Walls for $90K....\"here that this damn money and go away!\"  The whole fiasco reflects very badly on the administration...these guys make too much money to be so horribly incompetent...Gary Crum",

I get being partisan, but if the last 8 years have taught me anything, it is that the Rs really do love party over country and will vote that way every single time.\n\nObama had his faults, and much of what he did I really disagreed with, but in the end, the division was mostly caused by the Rs and their supporters in the right wing media machine who made it their mission to delegitimize anything and everything about Obama, from the birth certificate issue to claiming that his kids weren't his, to somehow claiming that Jade Helm was some plan to take over Texas or something.  \n\nIn the end, it did more to divide this country than really anything I can think of, the Russian hacking is just putting a wedge into those divisions.",

If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance.

Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?\n\nAs for \"numbers\" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like \"mass immigration\" are meaningless. What quantity is \"mass\"? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer \"mass\".

Through all that, a few of us were defending TS, saying \"it's too early for those labels\" and very few were saying \"pump the brakes\" then.\n\nSo, now that there's more data and the bandwagon is getting dangerously top heavy, nobody really cares (or wants) a safe ride with brakes pumped at every turn, especially when you'er 2-0 on the first 2 turns. Fans want the thrill of being 1st to cross the finish line, with every heart stopping moment and every breath taking spectacle that makes them cling to their seats and squeal for more along the way. That's football, that's entertainment and that's what fans love.\n\nSo damn the brakes, full speed ahead! GO BRONCOS!",

It will cost a fraction of that - and this one is guaranteed to be a profitable excercise so in the end the actual cost is negative. \n\nAnd how convenient is it that, when we do that, the oil in existing locations will be able to supply our remaining needs for centuries to come - so no need to go ruin the arctic any further.

Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it.

I admit that, when I see the results of some of our elections, I do marvel at the results...but, as one of those \"damn liberals\", I still believe in \"one person, one vote.\"  Gary Crum",

I would say today, the Internet is a necessary aspect of being in modern society, and meets many of the definitions of a utility from a neoclassical/libertarian economics standpoint. With the FCC under-investing in broadband expansion, it is up to the states to pick up the slack. You are correct, marginal increases in investment in education don't necessarily increase performance, but the correlation isn't consistent.

Second, many of these diseases are contagious, so when un-vaccinated children get, say, measles, other children end up getting them too, causing them harm.  Third, when un-vaccinated children get the measles etc. it puts an unneccessary burden on the state harming our economy.

Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \n\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. \n\nI wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",

In 2012, the bottom 40% owned only 3% of total household wealth in OECD countries for which data are available.  By contrast, the top 10% controlled half of all total household wealth and the wealthiest 1% owned 18%.\"\n\nIt seems Ms. Paris, you forgot the other lessons of history: Economic and political inequality. Nor do you seem to remember in the immediate post-war, liberal economics was tempered by policies to reduce inequality and let many share in economic growth. It was far from a perfect time, but over the last 40 years there has been a drift from the concept of social citizenship and fairness back to hierarchy and competition. \n\nIrrational policies are leading to irrational response",

He makes the point, in particular, that if the Trudeau government doesn't act to rectify this new border problem public support, such as it is, for the government's broader immigration and refugee agenda will be compromised. When I raised this issue in a couple of my posts yesterday, noting that support for the immigration and refugee program may be nearing a tipping point (which is suggested by recent polling and studies), some responded to the effect that this simply can't be the case. Starry-eyed optimists should consider that when a decidedly pro-immigration commentator like Saunders is raising an alarm about declining public support for the government's program the problem is real.",

The HTDC approach is like giving Bruno Mars a grant-in-aid check for being a startup and bringing millions into Las Vegas. The need and reason for grant-in-aid is understandable but the efforts to use it in a behind-the-curtains method is something they do in Oz, not for Hawaii.  HTDC is a state corporation but trying to bureaucratize startups is something a state government would do.  It would be better if HTDC decided what the state needed, then invested in projects to provide local employment. The point is create a local hi-tech employment environment, not make somebody successful to relocate to Silicon Valley.  The way HTDC is operating is very passive, almost like sugar cane leaning in the wind. One area HTDC should be looking at is the massive failures in computer and engineering projects in Hawaii, like the total collapse of the DOT IT system.",

So, for everyone getting involved you have a restricted handgun, and most likely a restricted rifle.

Banks then securitized those  mortgages of questionable quality and sold them on (charging investment banking fees on top of discounted interest rates) to pension funds, sovereign investment funds and other money managers which was immensely profitable for banks and their executives. They knowingly and fraudulently falsified risk disclosure but it all came to a crashing halt when the inevitable happened, people who couldn't afford the mortgages in the first place, defaulted.

For the same number of years after that change, growth in both GDP and private sector jobs slowed (and even went negative). \n.\nThere was no magic involved, and no sudden change in the world economies. In the earlier period, the combination of relatively high top-end tax rates, multiple progressive brackets, and generous targeted tax deductions provided a significant incentive to create jobs for American workers and to pay them well. While many jobs were offshored during that period, newly created jobs more than made up for them. The Reagan tax structure (and rate) changes crippled those incentives and investment in domestic job creation fell.",

Where I worked, \"diversity\" training at times went too far. I agreed with the stated goals - a more harmonious work place.

It inhibited people from getting to know each other and talk about things other than sports, the weather. etc. To question some of the \"training\", which I did at times, made you \"suspect\" and in the eyes of some, in need of yet more training (indoctrination?). Laughable, except for the fact that it was causing, as you say, further divisions among us.\nThere is discrimination in this country, and that needs to be addressed.

Social Security, Medicare, and other widely popular programs are the fruits of social democracy.\n\nSecondly, comparing social democracy to Maoism is not really fair.  Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist, not a state socialist.  Government for the people, by the people, to benefit the people.  It's not Communism.  Mao and Stalin both were authoritarian dictators.  \n\nThirdly, is abolishing the 40 hour work week a \"reform\" you want?  How about those child labor laws?

The Colonies ran their government under the Articles of Confederation up until 1789. The Legion of the United States did remain from 1783 to 1792 (when the Army was formed), primarily used to combat and remove Native Americans from their land.  So, yes, there was a small \"standing army\" but not for the purposes of defense from a large European aggressor.  The militias absolutely would have been called upon in such and event.  This was further evidenced in the War of 1812 when Madison call upon state militias to assist in invading Canada (many refused or fought poorly).\n\nAnyway, while impercipient's statement isn't precise in detail, I think it is accurate enough for his argument.",

Prior to 1986 police mainly carried double action revolvers. There was a major shootout in Florida with the FBI where agents were killed because they ran out of ammo. After that occurred police starting carrying semiauto handguns. Police shootings occurred and many lawsuits filed because officers physically pulled the hammers back on there guns when train on a suspect. Juries determined the action of cocking the hammer amounted to declaring intent to kill. As a result departments started issuing hammerless guns without external safeties. The result is in a lawsuit filed today, the case is made that the mear pointing of the gun is intent because there is no safety on most guns police carry. These guns do not have the longer trigger pulls even tough they require more pounds of pressure then a single action with hammer back.",

The case would have cost a huge amount of money to prosecute and it only takes one juror to fail to reach a unanimous verdict, necessitating at least one retrial. It looks as though there have been dozens of motions and hearings in the last 18 months. There may have been a problem with chain of evidence, which could jeopardize any conviction.

In my past observations on this general subject I find that those , with few exceptions , doing most of the trash talking are those who lack traditional values.

She jumped for the dog and broke the chain. The one end of the chain started going down. It was pretty scary trying to regain balance when your feet are numb from the cold and there are large cobbles that move under your feet. In retrospect, I wouldn't cross it that high again but we had prepared for a long day hike not an overnighter. It is an epic hike but the river crossing was much more dangerous than I had imagined.

The fact is every Muslim is a potential terrorist.  Each and every one of them is a one man or woman terrorist organization.  We have to look at the risk factor.  Muslims pose a high risk factor.  This risk increases every time they attack.  So at what point do we take action.  Japan recognized this long ago and banned the Koran and Muslims.  So far this year there were 1268 Islamic attacks in 50 countries, in which 11,664 people were killed and 14,087 injured according to the site thereligionofpeace.  So when will the world declare Islam a terrorist organization and copy Japan and ban Islam as a religion and start calling it a terrorist organization?",

I suspect the insurance cost increases people are complaining about are smaller than they would have been without Obamacare. But the more important question is whether people have been saved from disabling conditions-- blindness, amputations, death -- by earlier awareness and intervention.

The proportion of Muslim women who cover their actual face is very small, so I think it's disingenuous to argue that legislation targeting them is an attack on all Muslims. A much larger number of Muslim women wear the hijab and no reasonable person has any objection to that form of Islamic garb.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the popularity of Islamic head gear of any sort varies from decade to decade and is therefore not a fundamental component of Islamic culture. If you see photos of Iranian or Turkish women in the 1970s, hardly any wore the hijab.",

It, if followed, does help.  Importantly, at the same time, it presents absolutely no threat to legitimate firearm owners.\n\n As many guns as we have in circulation it's probable that a criminal or other individual who would \"misuse\" the gun will find a way to get one.  However, that doesn't mean a law requiring private sale background checks won't help by making it more difficult.  regards, Gary Crum",

As President, he has learned a lot and is turning away from his original policies (and supporters) and away from the right wingers (Steve Bannon) and toward the moderates and democrats in his cabinet-- Jared Kushner, Dina Powell, Gary Cohn, and Gernerals Mattis and McMaster (some of whom were supporters of Hillary).

I remember the talk of hero categories in store meetings and I remember reading about it in the paper.  I also remember being told by management that certain flagship stores (ours was one) would be getting some much needed investment and renovation.  In the end that \"reinvestment\" amounted to a coat of paint.  When things continued to go wrong and newspaper stories surfaced that our store lease would be sold off, we were assured (both by mgmt in store, and in the press) that this was not so, that Sears was here to stay.

Will there be problems with it?  Of course but they pale when compared to the richest country in the world having to hold health fairs for its less fortunate citizens.

The poorly built Elwha dam had already had serious leak problems in 1912, taking out a bridge downstream. It was rebuilt but serious questions remained about its seismic stability. When Congress voted to take down the dams, attention was paid to their decreasing economic utility and hopes of more fish. The idea that NW WA was going to need reservoirs for drought was just not on the radar in the 1990s. \nNow with the worry about a large quake on the Cascadia fault, the Elwha dams' days would be numbered. Even if only partially breached, the dams potential for property damage and life safety hazard would be considerable. So was it cheaper to take them out or leave them as is?",

It came from a 'study' ginned up by the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy, which has oil and gas and coal companies as members.  Basically, the fossil industry wrote it.  Surprise!\n\nHere's something that's not a surprise:  Most independent economists have debunked it as using entirely unrealistic assumptions.\n\nAnother study by the independent Resources for the Future calculates the cost to be 0.19% of GDP.  That's $33 billion.  A big number, but nowhere near Trump's hysterical numbers.\nhttp://www.rff.org/files/document/file/RFF-DP-16-48.pdf \n\nParis by itself isn't enough.  But it's a start.

You know it was the Ottomans that lost Palestine in WWI, right? Why did the Arab tribes help the British defeat the Ottomans, do you think? To end 600 years of Ottoman rule, perhaps?",
