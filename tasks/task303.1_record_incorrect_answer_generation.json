Former graduate student Whitney 'Theda' Orlando, 27, is accusing 52-year-old professor Marcia Klotz of becoming so obsessed with her sex life that the pressure gave her an irregular heart beat, according to the lawsuit filed last year. After learning about Orlando's past work as a BDSM model, Klotz went on to exchange more than 200 emails with her student, asking for details about her sex life which Orlando claims 'blurred professional and personal boundaries' While the university acknowledges many of Orlando's claims, they deny a connection between the student's health problems and her coursework.. Student Whitney Orlando, 27, met professor Marcia Klotz, 52, when she took a feminist literature course in 2009. Their relationship became more intimate when Orlando shared her past as a BDSM model and child abuse. The two came to heads in 2012 when Klotz was serving as Orlando's mentor on a research paper on child abuse. The stress of uncovering her own childhood horrors led Orlando to develop an irregular heartbeat. She is now suing the school for $250,000 in damages and $1,000,000 in attorney's fees. The school acknowledges many of Orlando's claims but say they aren't responsible for her health problems. They also say that Orlando never once complained about Klotz before the lawsuit. Orlando has since transferred schools and Klotz went to work for the University of Arizona in June 2013\n Questions:Orlando, _ and Klotz's husband watched the film in January 2010 and Orlando says the atmosphere was so 'sexually charged' that it made her feel uncomfortable and that her relationship with the teacher 'was becoming increasingly romantic and sexualized'.",
