And as for patrolling the Seward Highway, it's a state owned road. Let them patrol it. If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance.

As to debt I had a good paying summer job that was also outside of my field of study but great life experience and a group of friends whom I still see 50 years later.

Russia's main export is oil and America's plentiful oil and gas was destroying their markets. \n     According to the smartest man in the room, the Russians join forces with a capitalist energy proponent (\"an imbecile and a fraud\") who praises the benefits of cheap American Oil, Gas and Coal. Upon the completion of the fixed election, rigged by the Russians, Trump unleashes the fossil fuel industry from crippling Obama era regulations, opens up drilling to once closed government properties and permits the construction of the two controversial pipelines. Oil prices drop everywhere. \nRussia's income shrinks. Are they that damn dumb?",

Creating a solution that requires them to stay out of trouble, work and pay taxes, get a drivers license solves a lot of the issue. Identifying the 5-6 million who are not the problem, and shines the light on the 5-6 million that are. It takes half the illegal population and gives them a reason to pay taxes, act right and not cause trouble. That's what we want. And if they do they can pay a fine and earn a limited citizenship.",

Toronto and Vancouver. \"\n\nOh dear.  The BoC really doesn't get it.  Take Vancouver.  Of course a rise in unemployment would be bad but the idea that it would result in a severe price correction in Vancouver doesn't hold up.  Take some guy making $62,000 a year.  Terrible if he loses his job but he isn't the one who is buying the $2,000,000 former drug den - already striped and ready for demolition! -  in East Van.  It's offshore money.  Prices are completely detached from local ability to pay.  How is this not obvious?\n\nIf anything the causation runs the other way.  Some exogenous shock reduces the demand for RE or reduces prices and THIS has the effect of reducing employment through reduction in RE and related areas.\n\nMemo to JT-Read the SCMP/Ian Young for solutions and then act.",

I'm just curious how you think about this issue.\n\nThe Hawaii suit has a chronology of Trump's statements on the Muslim ban on pages 7 through 11.  Several of the quotes are responses to questions about how Trump's position on the Muslim ban might have changed.  Apparently, he never disavows the idea.  \n\nHere is a recent example:\n\"Then, on December 21, 2016, following terror attacks in Berlin, Mr. Trump was asked whether he had decided `to rethink or re-evaluate [his] plans to create a Muslim registry or ban Muslim immigration to the United States.' Mr. Trump replied: `You know my plans. All along, I’ve been proven to be right.'\"\n\nThis suggests to me that the \"pivot\" is rhetorical and that the goal is still a Muslim ban.\n\nAccording to the suit, the original call for a Muslim ban \"remains accessible on www.donaldjtrump.com\".",

If you've got children (or ever were a child, for that matter), maybe it makes some sense to value the health of the planet a little more than your comments would suggest you do.\n\nIncreasingly severe weather events like our recent floods will harm ever more citizens, financially, physically, and psychologically; drive up insurance costs; damage infrastructure; and risk catastrophic losses of biodiversity, on which we depend. Maybe worth breaking up your drive a bit to avoid this, no?",

And not where she is supposed to attend.  Nationality parishes were abolished years ago.  Accepting what the Teaching Magisterium has to say about which parish to belong is another starting point.  Apparently both Quesnelle and Weldeab are thinking for themselves about which parish to attend, despite Canon Law.\n\nOther local Catholics like Heywan Weldeab of Canton Township also found the event helpful.

Those things represent a yearning toward the imaginary and the impossible, and a nihilistic rejection of all reality.

If you look at the highest income earners in the world vs. the lowest income earners in the world the gap has shrunk HUGELY as compared to what it was in, for example, the 1980's.  This decline is mainly due to global trade as the lowest income countries have seen their incomes rise substantially faster than high income countries.\n\nThe only place where inequality has grown is within the confines of individual countries.  In low income countries the lowest income earners in that country might now earn 10 times as much as they used to while the highest income earners might earn 20 or 30 times as much.

I suspect there was no percentage in fighting over how natural law is best used, i.e., authoritatively v. by reason and evidence, so Francis ignored its conclusions. Professor Imperatori-Lee highlights the romanticism, or clerical idealism, often brought to this topic. Meghan Clark also notes this.\n\nEight women is progress over none, but not nearly enough in a conference about male and female relationships, regardless of how talented the women were.

Donald Trump, IMO, the consumate Snake Oil salesman, has spent his like creating impresssive perceptions of himself, and it's worked rather well for him.\n\nHowever, he's now in a position of immense power which also comes with high expectations and tremendous accountability.  He enjoys the power and resents the accountability.  That accountability accounts for his exceeding low approval ratings....35 % is the lowest of any President since such polls were instituted.  For more and more Americans, their perception of Trump has changed and they're rejecting the Snake Oil.  I would suggest their perception is more reflective of reality",

A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

He had been greeted warmly by the natives who helped him and his vast ship and crew survive in the foreign land by providing food and guides etc. However his arrogance and disrespect for the people had caused them to stop this gesture of goodwill. Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun.

The children wanted to know what I was going to teach the poor. My response was that they were going to teach me. They wondered aloud what I could learn from the poor! I promised to share my learnings w/ them upon my return.

In NYC, garbage collection is absolutely essential with tons piling up blocking the streets within a day or two of failure to collect.  The dire need of service creates great power to extort compensation.  In NYC, unions played a big role in the problem.  The private enterprise companies were hamstrung by unions who knew to power of a strike which would literally shut down the city within days.  With union solidarity, competition between companies was constrained and as a last resort the city assumed the garbage collection function attempting to bring unions and infrastructure under control.

Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).

The current proposals would eliminate the ability to split this form of retirement income with a spouse. On the other hand, all of the MPs have glorious pensions which get $6.25 of tax funded matching for every $1 they contribute. So in 2016, when an MP contributed his max of $25,370, his tax funded matching was $158,532.50, for a total accumulated value of $183,932.50. So after serving 6 years the MP has a retirement nest egg of $1,103,595 which he is allowed to split with his spouse upon retirement and is fully indexed. The spouse never worked to earn that income, yet is allowed to split it. If Morneau and the Liberals want to talk about fairness, maybe they should start with a look in the mirror! Most pensions offer a maximum of 1-1 matching. Although I doubt any politician, red, blue, yellow or green would vote to pass this!",

US Navy, US Army, US Postal Service, US Air Force, etc, etc...The simple answer is because their country is the US, not America.

If there is to be an income tax, it must be a flat tax where everyone, from the poor to the rich, pay their fair share and no one is exempt. Also, to create a taxation system, you must first build a bureaucracy to support it. It literally defeat the purpose of a tax if it is used to create the bureaucracy to collect it, state's version of the IRS, right? Maybe it is the way for the House to create more jobs?? Personally, I would prefer a sales tax if we must have such a thing. Apply it from Wrangell to Barrow at the same rate. Michael, bad solution is just as bad as no solution at all.

The word \"screwed\" was being used by those present. Back home I think words like \"embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" would be appropriate in describing the reaction to our Prime Minister's behaviour in front of 10 major allies and trading partners. Justin Trudeau has yet to learn what leadership and diplomacy mean, for he possesses neither of these attributes.",

They don't collude with each other and therefore don't favor one side over another with virtually zero chance to alter election results ... in other words, little or no opportunity to diminish the \"legitimacy of our form of government\".\nPartisan groups, however, can and do conspire to control the outcome of elections by favoring their party's candidate.

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap. The team slowly fell apart and conveniently Lacroix retires so that his \"genius\" reputation as a GM stayed in tact.  Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

We need only consult with those people living in open \"marriages\" to find out what the persuasive arguments are.\n\nIt's time for the laity to grow up and stop the outdated and false Kinseyan notion that sex is extremely important for life aside from reproduction.

Every spring native trappers floated downstream in the high water, with canoes laden with rich soft furs destined for England and Europe.

Wealthy individuals and corporations benefit from all the publicly-funded resources of our state and country vastly more than working class and poor individuals, in terms of the economic benefit derived.   Who do you think benefits more from our infrastructure, rule of law, military security and educational system?  A working-class stiff or Warren Buffet?  Of course Buffet benefits more on an almost incalculable scale.  A guy using a street to get to his job doesn't get the same benefit as a billionaire who ships his good over that same road at a profit.  You can't tax people who have no excess discretionary income - there's nothing to tax.  And generation of excess discretionary income is the only meaningful indicator as to who should pay taxes.",

So the kingdom of God is \"like\" a mustard seed, and so on.\nI don't think we can reasonably argue that the metaphor of a seamless garment can be required of every believer in practice, since one's practical support for or opposition to many situations is outside one's control. (I will never declare war, sentence someone to death, etc.) The decision to abort a fetus or not, on the other hand, is one most women can and do make during their lifetimes. In this sense, I agree that this intensely personal decision is qualitatively different from most other decisions. And this in spite of my pro-choice position, which goes well beyond Roe v. Wade.",

The idea is to connect the high tech sector of waterloo, with that of toronto... but to also connect the more manufacturing and rising tech sector of london. We all know the fucking via train sucks from london to toronto. It takes forever, is probably comparable to flying in price, and you can drive there faster.

The reservation was centered in the Fort Yates Agency in 1873, located in South Dakota. So, in fact, it is not their land and has not been since the Treaty of 1868, in which the Sioux tribes accepted the reservation boundaries. The part the Sioux Nations do not accept is the 1877 annexation of the Black Hills. I do not blame them for that because it was done without the required approval of the Sioux tribes as stipulated in Section 2 of the Treaty of 1868.",

Conservatives, though, need to come to grips with the fact that we do not have a free market based health care system in the U.S. now, haven't for many decades, and will almost certainly never have it again.  Rather than arguing that repealing ACA will allow the free market to work (which is ridiculous, because the loss of free market controls in health care predated ACA by many decades) They need to think about what mechanisms CAN enforce cost controls.

Robertson's latest foray into incompetence is a new by-law that effectively restricts natural gas in new buildings in favor of solar and wind - because there is a shortage of natural gas in BC and he wants to emulate Ontario's \"green\" boondoggles.  Robertson and Vision Vancouver are a national joke void of rational thought or common sense.",

Mr. Rogan get your facts right. Nobody trusts the US. Sadly an empire in decline always has its former allies turn against it. Pakistan is merely following Machiavelli's principals of doing just enough to get the hegemon/ bully off its back. Don't expect Pakistan or any of your allies to do much more.

The probability that one may have an adverse encounter with a bear when in this area is quite high.

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him.

Plus, the twenties had nothing on the Gilded Age.\n\nAs for birthrates, I thought I heard that teenage pregnancies were decreasing rapidly.  Please don't forget that the rates of unwed mothers in certain populations were probably not that well calculated in the early sixties.  Additionally, I just read that one reason for the percentage rates being higher is the lower rates of births in marriage.  A micro example: my Irish grandmother had 12 children.

This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

But most Atheists go with it is the Theists that should prove there are G-worded entities as compared to having to prove again, what avoids existing avoids existing.\n\nTherein both Theism and Atheism are based in belief systems.

Wildlife do not follow human road rules and never will. Part of living in Alaska is knowing that and being vigilant.\nThank goodness it wasn't a child but it very well could have been in a speed obsessed city.

Then, an administration \"for the people\" put the stock market ahead of the worker who saved, and for seven years now, no interest on savings.\nWhy do articles like the above not consider that as the chief reason for the despair of the working class, the inability to put their money anywhere? And bank fees, even take away from any savings they have. The Bloomberg writer of this article has credits clear back to 1986, it might seem she would have an understanding? Perhaps she's led a good life and the issues of most workers are alien to her.\nWhen one is old, there are very few ways to make money, especially when technology giants disguise age discrimination in H1-B work visas.\nRetirement is only in the stock market, no?\nWhen your competition the government itself, what chance have you?\nTime for change, OK?",

Do it yourself.\n5.\tWhy should I pay for a judge or courtroom if you want to sue somebody?\n6.\tSeems to me you are just as much a taker as the person wanting healthcare.\n\nTo continue; the GOP mantra is that health care is simply a product. They have no objection to people paying for that product; but they have HUGE objections to paying for somebody ELSE to have that product. Therefore, ANY reduction of public taxes to provide for healthcare is a good result, better than the status quo. The US won't need healthcare when all the uninsured just die.",

If you cross reference the list of historical properties listed online with the C&C property tax website a number of them are also listed as residential A, meaning that a house assessed at two million dollars in the residential A category would normally pay $12,000 in property taxes, but only pay $300 if it classified historical.

To me, those are not typically pitches guys hit unless they know they're coming or they're just locked in big time. \n\nAlso, Peralta and Pollack both put great swings on curve balls that were down in the zone; they sat back like they knew breaking ball all the way. Then you had Descalso in the second who looked fooled on his K, like he was expecting something else and was mixed up.\n\nI didn't see anything I could pick up on TV but also didn't watch any replays much closer. \n\nOverall, Arizona was strong our pitching staff stunk up the joint.
