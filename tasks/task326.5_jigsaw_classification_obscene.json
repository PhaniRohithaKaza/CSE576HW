So, um, duh, the British government encouraged emigration to the colonies for political purposes. Maybe you are confusing Britain with Portugal and Spain (countries that feared depopulation and thus restricted migration to their colonies)?\n\n2.  During the period you mentioned, um, visible minorities were a tad reluctant to emigrate (roll eyes) to Britain because Britain was grabbing and using blacks as slaves, and had racist restrictions against brown-skinned folks (no more than a fourth of a ship's crew from India could be Indian) similar to bans by Canada (head tax, Kobiashi Maru).",

The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like \"mass immigration\" are meaningless. What quantity is \"mass\"?

Instead, I have entered numerous startup competitions, and have won a number of them.  This has had multiple benefits:\n1.  I received funding I needed to take another step forward, without having to give up any equity in the business, and,\n2.  It helps to validate the business opportunity.  Yes, one can win a competition with a bad product that won't make it in the market, however, when you start winning more than one, it absolutely has to help validate your idea.  My wins have come from both Audience votes and Judges votes.  \n\nThank you for sharing your insight.

His background and the facts and circumstances leading up to his arrest and guilty plea suggests he was trying to make himself more important to the Trump campaign than he actually was.  He claims that while travelling in Italy, he just happened to meet a Russian professor based in London who just happened to have “substantial connections” with Russian government officials, who just happened to “appear to take a great interest” in him and just happened to introduce him to a woman who he said was Putin’s niece, and he believed them.  He then tells two perfect strangers that he had “connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate Trump and President Putin,” and returns to New York to work on that narrative.  I can't believe anyone in the Trump campaign took him very seriously.",

Given the problems with locally owner businesses and journalism today, here's hoping the next 150 go so well!\n\nWhile I might make a few comments on individual stories, here's a brief thought on the \nGuard's early history--  \n--The early photos are excellent-  we especially love the precious  photo from around 1871 you  used   on the cover of section H, showing the  Guard office on the SW corner of 9th and Willamette-- note the dog lying at the feet of the men standing under the signs for Haveners  Market and the harness shop.\nHowever, where is the other Ca. 1871 photo?",

Still, to the chagrin of my peers, I never let them point toy guns (or even their fingers) at a human and say \"POW!\" No squirt gun fights, playing 'Army', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Cowboys and Indians' or Grand Theft Auto type video games (These came out later and as \"adults\" they played them anyway...). And I screened (to the best of my ability) their intake of movies and TV. Perhaps I was viewed as a hard ass, but, I know first hand that it sucks to be shot. Yet, guns have always been an important tool in my life and I'm not one to throw out a hammer over a black thumbnail. I've kept them handy and I've kept them loaded. If you haven't taken the time to discipline your children before getting a gun, maybe you should get a baseball bat instead.",

It bugged me to no end that I had a bozo for a FA who was collecting 1.5% on the value of my portfolio, not on how much the portfolio made,  while being given the pleasure of losing money.  I was paying him big-time MER while I bore all the investment risk.  Well, that didn't last long and I was lucky to break even when I got out.

This tax is a good tax that will raise revenue and largely spare the average middle class consumer.\n\nThanks for your reply.",

The main contributing factor to that gap is the racial conflict which corrupts every aspect of American life. In the US the real battleground for racial equality is over taxes and the front lines of that tax debate is health care. In Canada universal health care protects even the poorest of the poor from the indignity of not being able to afford proper health care. Not so in the US, and that difference has an enormous impact on day to day lives of individual Americans. For decades the Republican party has been using the dog whistle of protecting the individual against big government. In reality what this really means is that wealthy rural Americans in white communities need not finance welfare recipients in urban centers. This is not how tax laws impact Canadians.",

They had never before surpassed petroleum since the Bank of Mexico began tracking them in 1995.\n\nAnalysts pointed to slumping global prices for oil, which earned Mexico $23.4 billion in 2015, and improved economic conditions in the United States, home to more than 11 million Mexicans and the source of nearly all Mexico’s remittances.”",

Corporations look for the best deal for themselves at the global level, and domestic governments just 'fall into line'.  Politicians claim they want to introduce the 'Holy Grail' of better services & products at lower costs. Even if there were any costs savings to be had, the middlemen, including domestic governments are looking for more money to feed their 'organizations'.

Something has to be done about foreign ownership in Canada as that is what is driving up real estate prices in B.C.  There is definitely a housing crisis and it needs to be addressed.  At least Christie Clark was the first in Canada to impose a tax but it won't be enough.",

I can't help but get the feeling that the bishops don't see the educated adult population as much of a target for their church, so they constantly keep shifting towards the less educated in their focus.  That alone speaks volumes.  But I think it's this failure, or inability, or unwillingness to truly engage with a more educated laity and public that is behind something that comes off as acceptance of a status quo.  In truth, it's really not a status quo at all: it's simply an ongoing process of milking a population, and then moving on as that original population begins to ask the right questions.  A day will come when the bishops will face a stark choice: they will either have to address the more educated society, or shut it all down, because their marketplace, while all too sadly still large today, WILL shrink over time, as technology fuels education and sharing of ideas globally.",

Again, the CO2 it emits isn't a pollutant.\n\nAbout 60% of our electricity in Colorado still comes from coal-fired plants.  Where's the pollution?

Currently we have an exceedingly expensive tax funded transportation program (public streets and private vehicles), with very little tax support for less expensive options for people. Pedestrian orientated community planning, bike share and bike support intitiatves, and better transit services, can all reduce the exorbitant economic drag of the tax-payer supported system of extremely large and costly road infrastructure and the extremely high cost of the private automobiles that must be paired with roads in order for this particular transportation system to work.

The fact that these facilities exist has barely anything to do with the ANC. All the ANC did was plug people into them without having the foresight to increase the capacity to cater for the increase demand. The sad truth is that the ANC has failed on pretty much every metric. The only sadder truth is that you don't see this, as your blind support for them is what will end up leaving your kids with no future.",

The 1980 Alaska Lands Act did not make the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge \"available for drilling.\"  This landmark act mandated a 5-year study to assess the biological values and the impacts from possible oil and gas development on the coastal plain. Seismic exploration was authorized to determine resource values but any drilling was prohibited without a future act of Congress.  The coastal plain is the most sensitive biological area of the entire refuge, as the report to Congress well describes.  Oil drilling brings major impacts and is not compatible with the purposes of this wildlife refuge.  Congress would have to circumvent current law to drill in the Arctic Refuge.  To think that the State of Alaska is pushing to invade a unique and magnificent wildlife refuge that belongs to all Americans, when the National Petroleum Reserve and adjacent state lands offer clear development opportunities, is just pure greed.",

He was a complex man (supported black education but not the right to vote); a product of his time. \n\nWhere Arnold was ticked off at America & out for revenge, Lee fought the Union out of loyalty to his state, which democratically voted to secede.

When it comes to the number of children in foster care on any given day, Alaska was number one. Details here: http://bit.ly/2xRaW8f  There is no evidence that Alaska is the child abuse capital of America. The problems cited as reasons for Alaska’s high rate of tearing apart families, are as or more common in other states that take proportionately fewer children.\n\nNor does Alaska’s obscene rate of removal make children safer.

Atmospheric takes combustion air from the room it is in so there must be an opening in the stack.  Direct vent takes combustion air from the exterior of the house.  Additionally, all high-e units I know of have a pressure switch that shuts off the system if blockage is detected in the vent stack. So how does the CO enter the house. Hot air rises, so all buildings have a natural stack effect, that is, air is pulled to the highest leakage point. If the natural stack effect exceeds the stack effect of the combustion vent then the fumes will be pulled into the house.",

Canadians get a five year warranty because they pay for it, not because of an ethical short coming.  \nWith further research you may also find that Americans are unwilling to pay a higher price for a product with a longer warranty.  They may be more likely to save money up front and take their chances later, no amount of government regulation can change that kind of fundamental difference.  \nProduct warranties on coffee makers would fall under the economic umbrella of a business, not as an ethical concern.

Ridiculous You want two sets of rules then - you can be intolerant out of ignorance, but gosh darn it, no immigrant can think like you. Do you think they've even lived with protected human rights before like under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Are you familiar with the Charter?  Give it a read and you'll find out \"why\" you can't be intolerant anymore. You haven't met too many people from other cultures I take it.... they didn't come here to colonize and take over Canada, they came here to be free. \n\nI have kids who have zero intolerance - they have multicultural friends and don't even see skin colour.

In all honesty I find the traditional RC point of view both dangerous and embarrassing--wrongheaded to say the least. I have seen first hand well-intentioned people needlessly suffer in their vain attempts to appease Rome and her superfluous doctrines, to the point of illness (both mental and physical), as well as suicide.

QUOTED FROM THE ARTICLE\n-------------------------\nThe EEOC found no basis for her claim, they investigate pretty thorough on complaints of this nature. In addition, the company stated they have the reasons for her dismissal well documented, respectfully IGNATIUS TROUT. With the EEOC in her corner, and if what they said it is all well documented, she has an uphill battle in my opinion, she'll need more than her word on the things she is asserting, and the EEOC most likely interviewed the people involved prior to their decision.",

That is considered a direct abortion. I've heard that breast cancer discovered during pregnancy is very difficult to contain and aggressive treatment is required.  There are cases of breast cancer than can be treated and a healthy baby delivered. Certainly, every cancer is different and should be given the proper treatment regardless of church dictates.

You and your fellow journalists could begin to expose the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party. Such information as;  the heinous CCP has murdered 70 million of its own people since 1949. That there are no human rights whatsoever in China. That the poor pay twelve different taxes while the filthy rich pay none. That while perhaps 100 million people appear to be prospering in China, there are a billion that go to bed hungry every night. And worst of all, the continued attempt of the genocide of the tens of millions of innocent Falun Gong practitioners by the use of torture, slavery, organ harvesting and murder.

The problem is we learn the song by ear as kids.  For the longest time I garbled lyrics (example, donzearlylite) and it takes effort to relearn the song.  No national anthem registers more profoundly than the opening notes of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" played instrumentally.  Think of the Olympic gold medal presentations as an example.\n\nYes the the song describes war but it expresses the joy of the nation's survival (the flag being the symbol) and honoring the brave men (now men and women) fighting, some being wounded, and dying in its defense and the then unique concept of individual freedom.\n\nBut, you know what?  I am willing to be part of a national process to change the anthem though I seriously doubt I would support a change.  But I have learned over the years one never should say never.",

What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

Do we read their hearts and presumptuously condemn their sincerity, or do we treat them as we would like to be treated? \n\nDoctrinal purists would have them live as brother and sister (a nonsensical and bogus argument if there ever was one), or just \"suck it up\" and accept that they are to remain unworthy, second class citizens in the eyes of certain Roman prelates (notice I didn't say in the eyes of God).",

Even after accounting for the smaller offset of respending that $1 through the government economy, cutting the PFD still represents ANOTHER $500 million or so loss to the OVERALL Alaska economy. Yes, it benefits some in the government economy -- which now include the recipients of ‪#‎AKOilCredits‬ (SMH) -- but using ISER's numbers it is clear that PFD cuts will come at the expense of the OVERALL Alaska economy, making what already is a challenged economic situation even worse.

On the surface, it seems that China is rising; actually, it is not as strong as you think mostly due to institutionalized corruption by all level of government from provinces to villages. The Chinese tourist who scoop up all the brand named products overseas only represents 15% of the population. The rest still live in poverty and discontent. Majority of their income is from export, and we are till their biggest customer. 50% of their top officials 2nd generation is living in the U.S. with majority of their wealth. They're still years behind us in military technology and they know it. I don't think China will start a war with us.",

I shared a story of a 15-year-old who was shot to death by sheriff police in a nearby small town.  I explained the honor-roll student was on LSD, had stabbed his father and another person, and was cornered by police.  The bloody 4-inch knife was in his hand.  Police twice TASERed him to no effect, used non-lethal bullets, and then put the K-9 dog on him.  The boy shook off the dog from his right hand and as the dog went for his left hand a sheriff’s deputy used an AR-15 to put a lethal shot to the boy’s chest.\n\nAnticipating my question, “I’d kill him,” the cop replied as I ended my story.  \n\nThe police and the General Conference seemingly have limited options to force compliance.  \n\nBut does God have no choice but to force compliance by eliminating the non-compliant?\n\nIs Heaven (or church) without everyone actually Heaven?",

Hawaiian or not, everyone's voting rights, land rights, and the ability to hold public office, would not change at all.

Arguably, the inflation rate for Vancouver is misleading since prices seem to have peaked there and are now falling, but the same is not true for the other cities.

The US Bishops' pastoral letter responding to HV, 'Human Life in Our Day', was a moderate affirmation both of the teaching of HV and of the conscience rights of married couples. There were many priests who wrestled with HV as confessors, and many bishops who tried conscientiously to help them do it. I knew one very conservative priest who left ministry because he thought HV was wrong, but he could see no wiggle room for himself as a confessor. Many people remember or know about Cardinal O'Boyle's confrontation with the Catholic University theologians. I don't think O'Boyle was representative of the US hierarchy.

I guess like he hopes many Alaskans dont remember what he paid for TransCanada gas. I sure dont ever see any coments on the subject. Along with his hiring of extremely expensive contractors in support of his gasline folley. He is driving out state into bankruptcy and he knows it unless he gets the PFD. I can only imagine oil companies are drooling at the thought of selling thier gas to a government run gas line that they did not have to invest in. This governor is NOT looking at Alaskans intrest. He is looking at huge proffits for the oil companies. Especially when OPEC quits flooding the market. Again carpet bagging at its best, legalized crime bullying our legislators into submittance.

You may insist on having \"the best\" of everything — for instance, the best car, athletic club or medical care.At the same time, you have trouble handling anything that may be perceived as criticism.

Law enforcement found it helpful when responding to an address, knowing that there is a firearm present. However, the intent of the law was to improve gun safety, which did not happen. Their gun crime statistics never changed from the established trends.\nOne of the more striking aspects of the program was the IT cost. The fees charged never caught up to the IT cost. The ACA showed that the US government can't perform large scale IT projects due to the \"qualified\" low bidder laws.  The US government can't secure digital information, either. \nIf the liberal, nice guy, Canadians could not make a firearms registry result in better gun crime statistics, then how can the US?",

It's just not worth it.\n\nTrucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.\n\nConcurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them.",

Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

AK DOE could set up regional boarding schools.  This would lower adminstrative, teaching, and school plant costs!  This would greatly improve education opportunities for students and the health of students.

Little or no effort is expended by the city to reduce impacts on adjacent houses. As evidence of this, just take a look at the looming Hyatt Hotel nearing completion at Oakway Center. Substantial light pollution from its parking garage streams onto adjacent neighborhoods. The hotel creates a canyon of darkness during daylight hours. All the while, the entire project is aesthetically deficient. Developers have plopped a hotel onto a parking garage. Greater consideration by the city of Eugene for nearby houses would have resulted in a hotel complex that served the purpose of the developer while also being more suitable to the neighborhood. My advice for the 32nd Avenue and Hilyard residents is to sit down with the developer and assess how perceived impacts can be mitigated through careful design.

I am speaking here, now, of those who commit suicide, not those who kill from lack of respect for human life. A mother whose child was killed was asked if she could forgive the person who killed her child. She said that judging him was not her burden. That it was God's burden to bear. Someone chose to pull the trigger. They will be responsible for that before God.  But our job is to try to see as God sees, with Mercy rather than judgment. We enter into the mystery of being human.

Delivery trucks had to be halal certified, so drivers also had to be Muslim. It was done without public knowledge, and only realized when popular bacon sandwiches were no longer available. Cafeteria managers making the changes were Muslim, and refused to allow pork into school cafeteria, even trying to police what food was brought from home.

So, Prof. Milner, you rang my bell w/ this article and I will again make another contribution to CB!

Increasing taxes on small business owners (who employ majority of workers) or the rising middle class (the majority of \"high\" earners) stifles economic growth. And I am cynical but I don't believe income redistribution via high taxes on the \"wealthy\" is going to get folks in Kahala, Manoa, or Waialae Iki to voluntarily move to Kalihi or Nanakuli....Isn't it really up to each of us to get off our high horses within immaculate bubbles to figure out little actionable ways that we can make a difference to help the disadvantaged and those especially who strive to make a better life for themselves?",

What more could a 21st century Alaska Republican want in the way of others bearing the pain?\nPerhaps, in the spirit of \"we all sacrifice\",  we could also cap PFD cash payments to 4 per family? I'd favor THAT one!\nI’d see this as a better stopgap approach - as long as we used the 3-5 year pre-sunset period for a MAJOR PFD revamp, bringing it more in line with Norway & the “sovereign wealth” funds now providing resident and governance benefits in other oil producing nations.",
