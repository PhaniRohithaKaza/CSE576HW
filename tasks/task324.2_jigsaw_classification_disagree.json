Calling xenophobic parties far-right makes as much sense as calling them far-left, or far-up or near-down, or behind-whatever. Please analyze policies for their real content, not for their position on some imaginary spectrum from left to right.",

We are the last holdouts who still shop \"the old-fashioned way\". They have already netted the yuppies and internet-savvy youngsters and are mopping up the last few disbelievers - the \"shoe-shiners\".\nBut with a price-earnings multiple of 180.7 today, the company is on shaky ground. It would take 180.7 years to recover your investment with Amazon at today's earnings. This is almost twice the level at which the Japanese stock market collapsed over twenty years ago. \nYes, this is what the dot.com bubble felt like. Massive valuations and no earnings. I love ordering from Amazon. But the empire may be built on quicksand. I wouldn't bet money in this game.",

If such were to happen, then a lawsuit against the government of North Korea could next be filed in a U.S. federal court with the ultimate goal being a seizure of any assets should North Korea someday wish to engage in commerce with or within the borders of the United States.\n\nIt's sobering to realize that no monetary penalty eventually won, however large, would ever be likely to restore their son to them as he once was.  But I could understand the family's wish to pursue the matter to the bitter end because sometimes, the desire for vengeance is what gives us humans a purpose in this life.",

The military-industrial complex, Intelligence services, and US political establishment in general (and its media echo-chamber) have a vested interest in maintaining hostilities between US and Russia.

There is a condition called pica which is a specific form of this condition typically related to iron deficiency.   Also, a lot of women crave certain foods during pregnancy they would not otherwise want to eat.   \n\nI'm not sure why medical science accepts nutritional deficiency as the basis for medical conditions in these specific cases (pica, pregnancy related cravings), and rejects it as a possible contributor to overeating and weight gain.

Retired military officers can retain their security clearances, with periodic checks.  Flynn’s last background check while on active duty occurred in June 2010 and he retained his security clearance when he retired on August 7, 2014.  The last security check to retain (not reinstate) his security clearance occurred during the Obama administration in January 2016.  If it was revoked upon his retirement in August 2014, he would not have had a background check to retain it.

I think far too many of the big guys still think all they have to do is say \"sorry\" - and ignore a real look at how the world-wide Catholic Church and world-wide religious orders all behaved in the same way.\n\nThe change that is needed is huge.  It is not just tweaking canon law here and there, but changing their own minds and hearts on issues that JPII and BXVI promoted - power sharing with laity and women.\n\nToo many current bishops learned to keep their minds and their mouths shut.

The GLOB and Mr Saunders pretend that voters are succumbing to their own negativity while in fact  it is  the status-quo world which is falling apart, because it is ordinary voters who are seeing through the lies and abuse of the present political system, which the MSM like the GLOB are slaves to.\n\nMr Trump's election should be seen as an indication that 'you cannot fool all the people all of the time' and not as something negative.",

When I pointed out that the only physiological measure of the effect of hunting we have is the length of harvested rams' horns and their ages, I think you then argued that if the horn sizes were declining then that must mean the sheep weren't skinny. But the ewes (and presumably the rams) are skinny. And the number of ewes and rams have declined proportionally, which suggests that hunting is not the cause of the decline. And horn sizes and ages of harvested rams haven't declined. All of which points to nutrition, specifically (perhaps) the lack of protein, particularly in summer, when ewes should be fattening up for pregnancy, winter, and lambing early in spring.",

If PO Armstrong used deadly force for any reason other to protect himself or the public (and that does not include a car theft) he has violated the terms of his employment.  There are reports that at least one of the shots fired by PO Armstrong at Micah McComas was fired at point blank range, which raises many troubling questions about Armstrongs actions.",

VIPS did the forensics on the Guccifer 2.0 file and found it was produced somewhere in the eastern USA and that it was overlaid with a template as it can be bought on the internet to make it appear \"Russian\".\n\nWhy didn't the FBI do the forensics on the Guccifer 2.0 file? Why didn' the FBI insist on getting the DNC server? The answer to both is that they didn't need to, they already knew it was a leak.

And Obama was all about the \"they make a desolation and call it peace\" approach to \"humanitarian intervention\" in Libya, Syria, Yemen, etc.  This was the core problem with Clinton, at least on foreing policy (ignoring the glaring and massive problems Trump presents for brevity's sake) -- she promised (literally) to expand Obama's militarism right up to the point of direct military confrontation with Russia.

Biogenic gas produced by methane producing bacteria below 100 C has a distinct isotopic signature.  Thermal gas is cracked by temperatures above 200 C and also has a distinct isotopic signature.  The origin of the gas is important because the big oil companies are not extracting shallow biogenic gas in aquifer zones, only thermal gas from deep zones.  \n\nIf this woman did the proper sampling and tests, they would be conclusive.

It's much easier to fly from city to city. You can't have much of a family life until you can fly by plane.\n\nMost Airlines won't accommodate such travel schedules. Without a personal plane, most resort to recreational vehicles. More than one great entertainer has been killed in such plane rides.\n\nAnd if you're going to make such extensive tours you do need to have homes so that you can have a normal family life. Just commute from your plane to the city of the performance and be back again at night. If the band occupies a large house then so much easier for rehearsals. Just do a sound-check and perform.",

The roadways of Lame County don't have continuous, fixed-width shoulders. That means that sometimes cyclists can ride on the shoulder, and sometimes they must take the lane. Adding rumble strips makes this transition difficult enough that most cyclists will just take the lane and stay there, which would not be most folks preferred option in the absence of rumbles.

Bike touring is a growing part of our local tourism dollars and we shouldn't be creating hostile infrastructure for these visitors who tend to spend more money than most.",

Now, after completely destabilizing the Middle East, we want to wash our hands of the whole thing and pretend that the mass migration of people into Europe had nothing to do with our votes for George W. Bush and his Congress which voted overwhelmingly to go to war in Iraq, thanks mostly to Republican intimidation and Democratic cowardice (with notable exceptions like Ted Kennedy.) The bishops are doing a good thing by reminding people that we have a responsibility to at least help clean up after our mess by opening a door to the very people we drove out of their homes because of a war that George Bush fought to finish off his daddy's grudge with Saddam Hussein.",

Like the letter writer, I never gave those flags much thought, although certainly not a fan.   The horrible event in 2015 changed some things quickly.  Several big companies would no longer sell Confederate merchandise,  VA cemeteries would no longer display the flags, states wanting the emblem removed from their flags, license plates, flags removed from capitol grounds, etc.  No mystery why it would give anyone pause to see Confederate flags displayed.",

According to the transcript, Trump tried many times to get Comey to pledge loyalty to himself, like a mafia don, and even tried to manipulate Comey into making a self-incriminating statement about an ongoing investigation.  Reading between the lines, Comey sensed a trap and saw how Trump was making a clumsy, artless attempt to get him to say something he could later hold over him, but Comey was too smart to take the bait and kept silent.  Comey was also smart enough and wise enough to write notes of his conversation immediately after his meeting, to protect himself.   (BTW it's almost certain the room was bugged).",

Classified as a paraphilia, an abnormal sexual behavior, researchers have found no effective treatment. Like other sexual orientations, pedophilia is unlikely to change. The goal of treatment, therefore, is to prevent someone from acting on pedophile urges — either by decreasing sexual arousal around children or increasing the ability to manage that arousal. But neither is as effective for reducing harm as preventing access to children, or providing close supervision.\"\n\nhttp://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia (July 2010)",

Within a year, the economy got better and has pretty much stayed on the same path since then. Trump has done nothing to change it.\n\nIf he wants to show, yet again, that GOP economic theory is flawed, he can get his tax cut passed. There might be stimulus if he lets deficits grow, which essentially borrows money from the savings sector instead of taking it, although you eventually have to take it and the money paid in interest. Best to keep taking it now. Savings is not a component of GDP. GDP is consumption plus government and private investment plus exports minus imports. Supply side says that savings causes investment.

We always hospitalized 48 - 72 hours post surgery in the case of declaws under a regime of painkillers/antibiotics. Very,very few complications were ever observed. The only difficulties seemed to be in older cats , declawed because of badly scratched owners or damaged furniture. To suggest that owners will ever clip their cats nails on a weekly basis is laughable & naive! The comment that a cat became nasty after a declaw is equally silly! Minx, our first cat, serves as my inspiration. She was an elegant Burmese who lived for over 20 years in rural Aurora summering in Muskoka and going out to daily & successfully reduce the rodent population. Being declawed it didnt bother me that she often massaged the new furniture. John Mollard",

As basic as those items seem by today's standards they were state of the art for a time. But times change and criminals began to be better armed than law enforcement. .357 Mags started to show up, ruffling feathers. In the late 60's or early 70's , in Newhall, CA, cops found themselves in the middle of a shootout with a group far better armed than they were. If memory serves at least 4 officers were killed, and officers actually went to a gun store an seized some amount of AR15's to use during the fight-probably VietNam vets. Following that law enforcement began to adopt high capacity semi autos because that is what they were facing on the street. Things continue to change and law enforcement has no choice but to adapt.  I don't want to see another situation where, in the middle of an incident, the cops are scrambling for equipment.",

But they are pinko socialist types and we here in the US believe in the mythical individual. It takes events like this to show that we are in fact a great community and stronger  together . It takes great societies and communities to overcome such calamities, not individuals or billionaires of the sort we are so fond of celebrating.",

I guess they would look silly having their dept part of a two hatter investigation while two hatting themselves. They talked about one member who was full time at one Caledon station and a volunteer district chief at another Caledon hall. Apparently the oath and constitution meant nothing to them until the heat was on their organization. So I don't think you can say she's threatening their local when their own members had no issues two hatting within their own organization for years.

People who couldn't qualify for conventional mortgages wanted to buy nice homes and pushed brokers and bankers to develop new and less risk-averse strategies and vehicles. Then, as the market went up, they wanted to refinance, buy second homes, and lead the good life -- and once again, the market responded. Admittedly, they quickly learned how to dangle a very appetizing carrot in front of the public's nose, but it was always a two-way street and we were all partly responsible for believing that the real estate bubble would never bust. I think it's dangerous to always point the finger at the other guy and absolve ourselves of complicity in our problems.

It was then, that men and men only were selected to be priests.  \n\nThe trouble is, most of the seminaries really don't teach Church history---because the directors don't want any seminarians asking questions about ordained women in early Christianity.\n\nAs far as JP II's seminary education, it was conducted in the basement of Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieda rectory---during the Nazi occupation of [Krakow] and all of Poland.

This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

I find the carefully crafted language to be incredibly divisive.

Starting a non profit that funds interns and benefits a large group of students (Ainsworth, West Sylvan and Lincoln) is vital!  Why can't the community side do the the same?  What is stopping them?  They could fund teaching interns for their classrooms, just as Apoyemos has done. 2) A few years ago a SI family spearheaded a funding effort for a new playground at Ainsworth. Funds came in from both community and SI.  However, not enough funds were raised. Instead of abandoning the project all together the SI family, who no longer had kids at Ainsworth by the time the playground was complete, added their own money to complete the project to benefit all!",

Trump, who used to be pro choice, is all of a sudden \"Mr Pro Life' because he suddenly changed his mind when he decided his chances to increase his ego dressing were much higher with the GOP than the Democratic Party.  It was easy for him to change because he doesn't really care what he says.  He only cares about the results of what he says and those results were going to be much higher among the GOP base than the Dems.  I really hope Pro lifers who voted for this fraud will own their mistake when they really start paying the price for their vote.

The answer to this is simply that they were two very different historical contexts.  In the 19th century, virtually no white Americans considered Negroes their actual equals.  But many opposed slavery on moral grounds, and on the grounds that the country could not go on being half-slave, half-free.  But the slavery issue was not the focus and motivation of the men fighting. Their motivation was sectional.  The chivalry still taken seriously in military culture at that time required respect for one's enemy, and even friendship after the war ended.  None of these cultural factors were in play in occupied Germany.  We did not regard the defeated enemy as honorable and, as total victors, we claimed the prerogative of reestablishing a different political culture in place of Nazism.",

Obamacare, then, was a compromise that employed government subsidies combined with financial penalties for being uninsured to achieve something close to forced universal coverage (as opposed to actual universal care) utilizing the existing overly expensive private health insurance structure.

You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be with you.\" In Greek, \"Spirit\" is the neuter-gender \"pneûma\"; and the relative and personal pronouns translated here as \"whom\" and \"him\" are ALL in the neuter gender. (The two \"he\"s render no expressed pronoun.) In the Vulgate, \"pneûma\" is rendered by \"spiritus,\" which is masculine-gender, so the pronouns should be understood to be masculine also.\n\nThe thing is, we English-speakers don't like to use \"it\" to refer to an active intelligent agent with whom we are supposed to feel sympathy.

If they are infected, the parasite will either asexually multiply, cause disease and kill them or encyst in tissue and not result in disease symptoms.  If, and only if, they are eaten by something else (and not cooked) can they spread toxo and it would only be to the individual that consumed the cyst.  The cysts or protozoa die quickly when they are exposed to the environment when the animal dies and rots.  So for most larger mammals and animal in the Hawaii toxo runs into a dead end if it infects them.  Cats, who collectively shed billions of oocysts (eggs) into the environment can infect any bird or mammal that consumes it and each animal is differently susceptible to the disease.  Toxo may enter the marine ecosystem when there are sewage spills but that will depend on the level of treatment and if infected cat litter was flushed.  Humans don't shed toxo oocysts, so it doesn't matter if there is human poo",

Since, I have read thousands of research papers on lead toxicology, it begs a lot of thought about what was, what could have been, and concerns for the minds of the grandchildren now going through school.... and for their future grandchildren. We have known for more than a thousand years of the poisonous nature of lead exposures, yet we really don't behave as if we learn from many of these hints of how to move toward a better more sane future.
