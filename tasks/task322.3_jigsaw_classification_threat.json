The US Senate is more effective in this respect because, although it became elective due to a constitutional amendment (17th) in 1913, it provides for two senators for each state regardless of size. Our Senate remains unelected (despite efforts to change this that formed part of the Charlottetown Accord) but it has very considerable powers under our constitution, which was not changed in this respect in 1982.  Pratte is right that the Senate continues to be exceedingly circumspect in exercising those powers.  People who are worried about the future of democracy should be more concerned about a) extreme polarization on many issues and b) the increasing propensity of the judiciary to take sides and make law.",

Even with the Tappen Zee Bridge, it was build to connect New York Throughway with New England Throughway to help easing the congestion. Having been over that bridge several times, it definitely was worth the money to do so. Knik River Bridge had no real economic purpose unless to make people who owned land on the other side very rich at the expense of the American taxpayers.",

These revenues are generated from the 1% statewide lodging tax.  Reading through their prior budget years, it appears 5% annual growth is conservative (it's been much much higher the past 10 years).  If they increase the lodging tax by .8% for 4 years, they will increase the revenues by 80% for 4 years.    That means in year 1, they will raise $14,700,000 (80% of $18,375,000).  In year 2, the new tax will raise $15,435,000 (80% of $19,293,750).  Then $16M in year 3 and $17M in year 4. In 4 years, the new tax raises $63,358,838.  More than enough for a track event ($25M).   It's not surprising that Nathanson nor Edwards submitted any revenue projections or cash flow projections---this tax will raise a ton of money.  \n\nhttp://industry.traveloregon.com/content/uploads/2015/06/TravelOregonStrategicPlan2015-2017.pdf",

They're diverse and provide a bit more of a demanding personal perspective...what can each person do today/now, from where they stand (mainly within their family and close reach) vs. pointing to rome, pointing to a bishop, pointing to a politician, etc. \n\nThese reminders of our personal limits (and yet demanding personal obligations) upset some people here who seek \"saviors\" or surrogate decision makers around every turn, or fast, perfect answers. \n\nAnd my comments aren't as \"clerical\" as most stories and comments here are, which seem to always focus on rome, clerics, sisters, \"papa francesco\". \n\nWe have to look for all manner of \"walls\", where people who are comfortable are exposed to diverse and challenging viewpoints, and want to reject the stranger. \n\nNo walls.

The CO’s felt their safety was being put at risk and conducted a no-confidence vote against Mr. Schmidt. Where the funding for those unfilled positions went is anyone’s guess, but if the recent legislative audit of Goose Creek is any indication it was not even close to being used for its intended purpose. Since that no-confidence vote it's been nothing but constant battles between Mr. Schmidt and Correctional Officers. Almost all of which the Department has lost and it has cost the State hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements and lost arbitrations.",

If this is an experiment, then it is an experiment that is designed to fail because of reliance on half measures.\n\nThat's because this is not really a basic income, but really just an increase in social assistance rates. Whatever good intentions the government may have had, this experiment is undone by clawing back all income at a rate of 50 per cent. \n\nTo properly leverage the entrepreneurial potential that comes from the security of a basic income, the government should not be clawing back any income until about $30,000. Clawing back at a rate of 50 per cent of every dollar that a recipient earns simply removes the incentive to work. \n\nPeople who rail against the idea of supports to ensure decent incomes for all people fail to understand basic economics, which dictate that one person's spending is another person's income.",

I don't think so.

In 1998 the Senator Frank Merkowski spoke to Congress about building the road, again well before Obama came along.   Around the year 2007 Ted Stevens pork barreled $ 37 Million federal dollars  for Cold Bay; $ 9,million of that bought a hovercraft for King Cove.  The hovercraft failed as was expected due to operating cost that were in the million dollar a years range.  Now is a mega million dollar road and no-one has the cost of maintenance figured into the project.\n\nSo while you complain it is Obama's fault there is no road tell me honestly do you believe it took 4000 years to need the road or was it a politicians running for office in DC that made a campaign promise like Uncle Ted use to do that has created this mess.",

Without getting into the reasons for this \"enshrinement,\" what would the Church look (and act) like if the decision of \"worthiness\" was left up to God? I can site a passage from the Didache (\"Teaching of the Twelve\") that lends good evidence of how  early church fathers viewed the Eucharistic celebration, and it was nothing like the fetish-ness in which  traditional Catholics would describe today.

In Atlantic City, he was notorious for paying only half the invoice from contractors and telling them to sue him. The story is they wised up and simply doubled the estimates to get their money.\n\nWe are looking at a potential trade war unless we can talk with his advisors and children.

Depending on how you measure GDP the world's largest economy is either China or the US.  And yet Obama thought it was fine that China could receive funding under the Paris Climate Accord and could increase CO2 until 2030.  Makes you wonder!!!!!!!\nWhat I didn't say earlier, if world interest rates rise or foreigners no longer fund the US debt (just 2 possibilities) there will be a serious financial crisis in the US.  And it will not be Trump, Obama, Meryle Streep, Tom Steyer etc who will not be able to afford health care or struggle to put food on the table.

But times change and criminals began to be better armed than law enforcement. .357 Mags started to show up, ruffling feathers. In the late 60's or early 70's , in Newhall, CA, cops found themselves in the middle of a shootout with a group far better armed than they were. If memory serves at least 4 officers were killed, and officers actually went to a gun store an seized some amount of AR15's to use during the fight-probably VietNam vets. Following that law enforcement began to adopt high capacity semi autos because that is what they were facing on the street. Things continue to change and law enforcement has no choice but to adapt.

The reason that this plan includes the North County is more about territory than population.  As I have said the South County has no industries.  Tourism and the University of California Santa Barbara are the only \"industries\" of t he South County.  The North County's agricultural industry is highly productive; and, it now has 100s of vineyards.  If this plan doesn't split Santa Barbara County, and other counties that have similar divisions, it will fail.  The tax base alone is not balanced.",

How could Swift's testimony be true? Think about it. Her bodyguard sees a man lift her skirt, and the bodyguard does nothing? He does not even inquire about what happened? Here's the question: Are bodyguards trained to ignore the action of a relative stranger lifting the skirt of their client, someone they are trained to protect? I think not. Bodyguards are supposed to be aware of what's going on to the client. This makes me believe that Taylor either embellished or lied about Dent being a witness to the skirt lift. If so, what else is she fabricating?",

Artificially adding hatchery fish will only impede the natural reproduction of native wild fish.

With a great opportunity to allow the Elwha to heal naturally, it's a shame that we can't get out of our own way.\nThe Elwha watershed would heal itself and repopulate with sustainable wild runs of salmon and steelhead - and more quickly, if we'd just give it a chance.",

And  that's the way it should be - not by the Supreme Court arbitrarily converting Canada from a federation to a unitary state. \n\nThere would be more openness to unfettered trade within Canada if the federal government had acted to ensure that the benefits of NAFTA and other trade deals had been distributed more fairly across the country, across industries and across income strata.

This so called \"Innovation\" will by any learned estimate continue until the non-living entities are capable of designing, building, programming and repairing themselves - they (robots) will be mining metals & processing petroleum for the raw materials used in the construction of themselves.

Having a gun and knowing how to use it (which this woman clearly did not) significantly increases your chance of survival.\n\nI'm sorry the burglar wasn't hurt, because he'll spend a few years in jail and be out doing this again soon.

The studies have very good validity and it matches our clinical observations.  There is no drug that is going to stop this kind of abuse level, although some of them may mediate the hind brain push to continue the cycle.

In the end he accepted a plea deal for killing a US soldier and did the remainder of his sentence in a Canadian prison. \n\nOn the other hand, Mr Amar was picked up at a US airport in transit to Canada. He was rendered to Syria for torture by the CIA based on faulty information partially provided by Canada. He was innocent of any wrong doing.\n\nIf the government has to pay compensation for each time a foreign government arrests and processes a Canadian citizen we will go bankrupt.",

Why not vary development fees for new construction​  based on existing density.

It only takes one of these oocysts to become infected.  They are very durable and remain viable in soil and water for 18 months or more.  Long after the feces has decomposed into the soil, the oocysts remain.  Think about working in your yard on a hot day.  If an infected cat has used your flower bed or garden as a litter box in the last year and a half, and you swipe your hand across your sweaty brow, that could be all it takes to become infected.  Or you're in your garden and without thinking, you pop that delicious ripe cherry tomato or luscious raspberry into your mouth.  Insects,  rodents, and even worms have been shown to carry oocysts from feces to food sources.  Oocysts can also become aerosolized and inhaled.",

This does make my credentials as a scientist quite adequate, but I am no climatologist. I do understand what good and bad science is.  Bad science comes from paid guns working for tobacco or petroleum companies attempting to show that their industry does not cause harm.",

My bet is there was not that much revenue lost. I know personally that at a higher rate I am less likely to buy stocks vs fixed income and when I do am less likely to sell frequently and generate gains.\nIn Alberta since the NDP have been elected and the Liberals elected federally, we have seen top marginal rates on capital gains go to 24% from 19.5%!!

There is a count of major and minor errors in AL that go up as high, but 7 should suffice to start.   Remember, all it takes is one manifest heresy for a pope to automatically cease to be pope.\n\nIt may take years and decades for this pope to be corrected, but he WILL be corrected by a God who will not be mocked.

In fact a 4\" mesh net will more than effectively catch any size or species of salmon, from Pinks to Kings! The trick lies in the hang-ration, allowing a small mesh net to effectively harvest all species but in this case and even more importantly, allows for any species needing rebuilding to easily be released with minimal trauma. Using nets with mesh sizes intenddd to target the larger/largest of a species decade after decade has undesirable and potentially long-term negative consequences.

The plane broke into 3 major pieces, but it was so cold, the diesel jet fuel didn't atomize on impact to explode, as it normally does in a crash. Therefor half of the soldiers on board survived. Bill Shechter took the command van/hazmat response truck out to the runway 3days. There were bodies laying on the runway for over a day during investigations.

So, we can bomb ISIS but we can only materially support the Syrian rebels lest we come face to face with Russia which supports Assad in order to protect its Black Sea access to the Mediterranean Sea?\n\nThe author tried to explain the confusion. \"...The U.S. military said in its statement that Syria was a \"complex situation\" but that \"coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit\"...\"    It's terrible.

You can easily see numbers don't really matter.\n\nThat said, the US doesn't maintain aircraft carriers to wage war against Russia or China.  That's incredibly silly.

Surgeons and hospital based specialists like anesthesiologists and radiologists have massive charges and non-profit administrators have huge salaries. These are all private business decisions which the government has done little to curb.\nFact is that during Obama’s presidency, the rate of increase slowed and the uninsured rate went down nearly by half, even though Republican governors declined to cover millions of their state residents through expanded Medicaid.

For example, I went to a NSF summer program where it was useful to use calculus.  They present differential and integral calculus in three days so we could understand and solve most any problem. I returned to a school that had no calculus course and physics that used deltas.  \nSchools fail to allow students to reach their potentials because of the age based grade level structure which is a problem for those who have difficulty as well as advanced students.

In fact, business owners and their henchmen will actively connive to lower wages of workers so as to put more money in their pockets.\n\n\"Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate…\" - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations 1776",

Japanese youths became disenfranchised with a system that pushes them along the same old academic path despite reduced job prospects at the end, and expectations that blame them for the greater economy's woes.

Each of us is an image of God, and this does not include being \"fallen\". IMHO we are exactly as God creates us to be, with all our messiness. Book learning is neat and orderly, real life is not. From its origin, which was to prevent church property from being passed down as personal property, celibacy is about power and control, not about Jesus or the gospel. What I see, especially these days with so many confessions, is many folks, certainly not all, who still take part in church life see God as a threatening judge, and following Jesus as obeying rules that have little to do with him. Often they do not want to discuss seeing things any differently.  Others have just left.",

There was a house there called Bates House after the man who kept it. There I found Cpt. J.K. Limerick in command of a company of volunteers. It seems he had been sent there by General Lane... Bates and the others had induced a small party of peaceable Indians who belonged in that vincinity to enter into an engagement... They invited them to partake of a feast in an unoccupied log house just across the road from Bates House. While the unarmed Indians were partaking of the proffered hospitality, the door was suddenly fastened and they were shot down by their treacherous white hosts. Nearby I was shown a large hole which the bodies of the murdered had been unceremoniously tumbled.\"\n\n- Judge Matthew P. Deady",

You have made it clear that you have no problem taking a human life. Do you support the state sponsored killing of unarmed black people? BTW, you didn't respond to my comments about the Vietnam war.

And people will buy that criticism because it jibes with what they see.  \n\nYet RTD was always going to be an unsatisfying compromise.  Voters wanted both a *regional* light rail system and the ability maintain local land use control. They got that, but they also got the consequences on display here: ~3,000 voters made the right call for themselves but reduced the effectiveness of a system designed for more than three million. There's nothing mysterious about RTD's dysfunction, then.  We've gotten what we wanted.  But turns out that what we wanted didn't make sense.",

But when closely read together, you can learn a great deal about Trump’s financial affairs.\nTrump appears to have overstated his income, by a lot, which could be the reason he has so far tried to avoid releasing his returns.\nBy adding up all the revenue that Trump claims as income, a clearer picture emerges of the GOP frontrunner’s business interests. His enterprise looks a heck of a lot smaller than the real estate colossus the candidate claims\nTrump may be paying a relatively small amount to Uncle Sam simply because his business isn’t huge.\n\nHe is hiding something.",

Even if the demand isn't there from BC, electricity can be exported to other jurisdictions that need to displace electricity produced from coal.

Possibly she assumes that everybody has an extended health plan or the money and contacts to get decent services for their families. \nThose who pay (either directly as in BC for public health care, or through various taxes elsewhere in the country) face a shortage of doctors and lengthy waiting lists even for urgent treatments. They pay for their prescriptions and of course dental care is not included. It's a struggle for a lot of honest people and their families. \nFrankly I have far more sympathy for the working poor and for our disabled citizens and I would prefer that any additional funding goes towards meeting their needs as opposed to those of our prisoners.",

We’ll have to start working again to strengthen the law, and then again to strengthen the next law and again and again.  Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns, is going to take time.

Demand here is driven by a large number of families who want to live in a particular style of home, they're paying up not just to park their money there but to have lots of space for their kids, cars, woodworking workshops, etc.\nEven if these houses weren't occupied by owners, the families would still pay up to live there. Instead of high property values driving up the rents, you'd get high rents driving up the property values. Where there's demand, it doesn't matter much who invests. Investor money would always find them, foreign or Canadian.",

I think your last sentence pretty much answers your own question.  \n\nSo if you want \"good\" to come from church, and you define church as being the organizational leadership, then you've got your answer in the scandal.

The county commissioners need to consider the negative impacts these closures will have on our public forests.   When I come upon illegal dump sites in the woods, usually 80% of it is recyclable.

Same as for murders, the gun is handy to settle disputes more often than having to search out other means when one is angry. There are more murders by guns than by knives or baseball bats.   Research shows that people kill with guns because there is little time between the thought and the event.
