    "Definition": "Given a debate topic and a sentence from the debate with tags 'topic' and 'sentence' respectively, classify the sentence into one of the types given below - \nPolicy: A sentence that proposes a specific course of action to be taken and typically has model verbs like \"should\" and \"ought to\". It cannot be proved with objective evidence but can be supported by a logical reason to infer from. \nValue: A sentence that contains value judgements and not any specific claims of actions to be done. It cannot be proved with objective evidence due to its subjective nature. \nFact: A proposition sentence with facts or conditions that aren’t distorted by one’s feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. It has a truth value verifiable with objective evidence available then. Predictions about future don’t count as facts. \nTestimony: An objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Often, evidence for it is not publicly available. \nReference: A sentence referring to a source of objective evidence. Usually, a citation or link to a published work from a well-known source comes under this type.",
