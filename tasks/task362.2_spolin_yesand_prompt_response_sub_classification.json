    "Definition": "Considering the given prompt, identify which of the given two responses agree with or accept the prompt and extend its context implicitly or explicitly with some additional information as part of a dialogue exchange. Return the identified responseâ€™s tag (\"Response 1\" for first response, \"Response 2\" for second response) as answer.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Prompt: We'll make a solemn promise. This does not leave this cold storage.? \n Response 1: Grandma, the counter's bending because of how much pressure you're putting on it. \n Response 2: We'll cut our long thumbs off before we tell anyone.",
            "output": "Response 2",
            "explanation": "The prompt mentions about a promise to keep something secret. Response 2 agrees and extends the determination of keeping the secret. So, Response 2 is the right answer."

            "input": "Prompt: Do you believe you're going to jail? Because you're going to jail. \n Response 1: That's what you say, but I believe jail doesn't exist, therefore I'm not scared. \n Response 2: OK. Should I go out there and admit that I brought him back here or should I play dumb?",
            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "The context of the prompt is about going to jail. And Response 1 gives some additional information about the notion of going to jail. Hence, its in the same context as the prompt and extends the prompt. So, answer is Response 1."

            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "Response 2 talks about a shoe which is in context with the prompt and has additional detail to extend the prompt. But response 2 is unrelated to the prompt. So, answer should be Response 2."
