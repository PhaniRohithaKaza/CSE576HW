The cost of connecting large numbers of low capacity power sources to the grid is very high and explains how Ontario has spent billions on \"improving and upgrading the grid\" to connect these sources. Solar and wind may be fine for standalone on-site power sources, but make no sense at all to be power sources in the public shared electricity grid.",

In America, anything Russian is very bad. If Trump can be caught talking to any Russian officials before he won, he could be charged with treason. That's the game plan. \nb) Presidential Executive Orders are numbered, and those that's not classified must be published.

Why did Obama issued a classified EO at the final dates of his term? \nc) Trump can now read all of the EO's. He found the said classified one. He asked his CIA head to decipher.

But, I believe him when he said that, contrary to some criticisms, he did not beg for his release.  Rather, he did exactly what he should have done.  He says he talked about the rule of law, and suggested the Pakistanis marshal the evidence they had had justifying Khadr's detention, and lay charges and give Khadr a fair trial, or, if they didn't have enough evidence to justify laying charges, and trying him, they should release him.\n\nThat the Pakistanis released him is a sign they had no real evidence, not that Chretien did anything wrong.",

First, the average federal public service pension paid out is just over $25,000 annually.  You can buy an annuity for that income even at today's inflated rates for $450,000.  That's still a good deal, but it's a long way short of the $1.2 million that Vettese pulls out of the air.  Second, that $25k is all the average public servant pensioner gets. Their pensions  are reduced by the amount of the CPP benefits when they reach the age of 65, even though they paid additional amounts for the CPP benefits. \n\nInstead of whipping up envy about public servants, why does Vettese not instead tell us how more Canadians can have financial security in old age?",

For example, you have truth that takes the shape of collective narratives like science, where truth is rooted in things like the periodic table and the laws of physics. This Mr. McKnight forgets to mention. \n\nWhat he does, is conflates narratives. He conflates a political narrative with another narrative, individual truth.

Liberal claim that they had, thus far, incurred $5-m in costs is absurd. As a downtown lawyer, I know of what I speak. Furthermore, the principles at stake here were simply too important to be decided by political interests. This is EXACTLY the moment when we rely on our independent judiciary. It is quite possible that a court would have assessed Mr. Khadr's damages at 0. He was repatriated and given a new lease on life. He has expressed NO remorse and relied upon his child soldier defence. Canadians aren't buying it. PM Trudeau most definitely had a choice. Not sure where your bold and incorrect assertion comes from.",

I don't see many people arguing for that, so why would we assume that whatever minimum wage we have now is the precise, perfect tipping point and should remain untouched? The content of this article only confirms what is taught in Economics 101...the labor demand 'curve' is downward sloping. Wages go up, demand for labor goes down. That the relationship is inverse is already understood. The exact slope and shape of the curve across a local economy is not. Maybe higher minimum wage will encourage more dignified, dedicated and effective participation in the work force and offset it's predictable hard cost inflationary and job reduction effects.  We may soon get a better idea as these policies roll out. At least the money is earned vs a guaranteed minimum income for just existing and reproducing.",

We don't  do that when we hear \"straight\".  When I was in the seminary we were told that if you were gay you cannot go to \"gay bars\". However, the straight seminarians were not told they can not go to straight bars. The fact is that some people go to bars to \"hook up\" in straight bars as well as gay bars and some people go to bars to socialize in straight bars as well as gay bars. The thought in the seminary was that if you were going to gay bars you were looking for sex but if you went to straight bars you were not. \n\n A parishioner  commented to me that even though I  was gay it didn't matter a long as I was celibate. You see, that is confusing sexual identity with sexual activity.  I have kept my promise of celibacy but that does not mean that my sexual identity \"doesn't matter\".\n\nPS: The archbishop denied my requests to meet to discuss this personally",

The latest response has been to \"educate\"/ask migrants not to cross illegally - but admitting that if they do cross, they will be welcomed with open arms immediately. Suppose they try to enter through official channels? They will be refused entry. This started happening in January and the Liberals say the summer crossings were impossible to predict? After the thousands of success stories from breaking the law, it's surprising more migrants aren't coming to Canada illegally -they have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain, including citizenship.

Was not even part of the thinking process.\n\nNow, how do I reconcile that decision with my Catholic faith. I don't because the church is not monolithic. Any of us, whether Republican or Democrat, can twist and turn our partisan politics in any religious direction to justify our vote. I did not vote for Trump because of my faith; I did so because I am a conservative. Hilary was not.\n\nI think that it is disingenuous to assume that good Catholics wear their religion on their sleeves when they vote. They don't. No one takes the faithful citizenship booklet to the voting booth; they hardly read it. Instead, we vote according to how we were raised and how we currently think.",

They are in the process of adapting to their changed habitat.  Will they learn to forage better on land and survive along the Arctic coast, even if at lower numbers, in spite of decreasing sea ice?  Will they interbreed more with the brown bears in the area?  Fascinating to watch.\n\nKeep up the good work, USGS!",

My experience is there is perhaps a handful of EFs available in the major metropolitan archdioceses I've lived in. EF is one of the Church's best kept secrets, and little is done to promote it, and a lot is done to suppress and downplay it. It's near miraculous it's survived with how much was done to disappear it. I think that if you study the two liturgies side by side, the EF clearly expresses the Mass is the Holy Sacrifice. Someone who hasn't been to both can't make that assessment. Obviously, many disagree. Is my \"contempt\" any more scandalous than Pope Francis' comments on rigid young Catholics who prefer the Traditional Mass who have something behind their love for the EF Mass?",

You should own and run a business because the risk/return relationship is favourable.  You don't own a business with the expectation of the govt supporting your feasibility by allowing the owner to sprinkle income to kids.  It's not just doctors, it is also lawyers, accountants, business owners of private companies, etc..  The govt doesn't owe you a special tax break that others don't get (deferred income).  The govt shouldn't allow you expense deductions that others don't get (i.e. write off phone bills, home office, car usage, meals, computers, etc..).",

Harper Conservatives announced an end to that Martin Liberal agreement with a move to 3% quite some time ago to become effective around this time. The Trudeau Liberals have essentially announced they will follow through with that approach with some changes, the main one being additional targeted funding.

It is insufficient to merely demonstrate that the U.S. has not authorized entry as that fails to demonstrate fraud within the meaning of the text of the code. So, no, unless the alien knowingly obtained and used, for example, a fake green card to enter the U.S. initially, this section does not apply. More commonly, they've overstayed a lawful entrance.\n\nInstead, most immigration cases are \"unlawful presence\" matters, which are not criminal, and focus instead on whether the alien has a demonstrable claim to be here.

Saudi Arabia: terrible human rights violator.  Which, I suspect, is the reason most commenters mentioned the sales by mouse and elephant.  Call for sanctions against Saudi Arabia!  I mean it's obvious it isn't worth THAT much to us. But, NO WAY we'd shake our fist at arms-dealing America, , right?

These activities closed down any chances they had for negotiations.\n.\nI don't agree with some of the ideals of the left but I certainly don't fault Obama for doing what he can to accomplish something. If Obama didn't push things into effect via executive order, your talking point would be that he did nothing in office.

It is the uncertainty they are reacting to, not the deficit itself.\n\nWhat we need to do is close a significant portion of the deficit this year, but to also make real decisions around how we plan to close the rest, even if that occurs in subsequent years.

Was a painful loss, but we had a GREAT time and spent a good deal of money doing so.  Kudos to Nebraska fans and hospitality.

It may be a tradition--or past-presidents may have been bullied into revealing their taxes--but there is no obligation for Trump to reveal anything about his taxes.  If he has done something illegal or hasn't paid them or paid enough, the Dems in the IRS would be on him in a nanosecond.  BTW, I'm thrilled to learn that Hillary is not POTUS.  That \"news\" which you hate to tell me is a constant comfort to me.",

Malikane could easily respond to this kind of stuff.\n\nAnyway, that you think mentioning Apartheid is some kind of indication that a paper is not serious Economics makes it clear that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

Once that was established, Pope Innocent 1 documented all of the fantastic tales from 300 to 400 years previous into highly edited script.   Thus was created the New Testament to add to the other One God religion, Judaism, to create the bible.  With the human military might of the Roman Empire, the fanatics now had real power to impose their arbitrary dogma on all residents of the same Empire.

Or you may be fighting a warming which will naturally reverse, as has happened before in earth's history many times. You dismiss the minority science at all of our peril. But if you believe all you say, back it up. Stop using all carbon based energy products, and all products and services that use them.

It amazes me time and again how religion can get away with 'stuff' that is not acceptable anywhere else.  It presents 'belief's of the first centuries as truths', that it is not.  It seems once a belief is held no incontrovertibel evidence can dissuade the belief...the belief is held even more adamantly and the evidence dismissed.

That's not an excuse for conservatives.  \n\nBut while you're at it, consider an article recently published in the NY Times, no conservative rag.  It says:\nArthur Brooks, the author of a book on donors to charity, “Who Really Cares,” cites data that households headed by conservatives give 30 percent more to charity than households headed by liberals. A study by Google found an even greater disproportion: average annual contributions reported by conservatives were almost double those of liberals.",

Many, if not most, of the immigrants coming from Africa are damn good people, hard working, generous, and only wanting a better life for their children. Better citizens, in fact, than many American born folks I have encountered. Unfortunately some of those children are committing a disproportionate amount of the violence and their community is so distrustful of law enforcement and \"the establishment\" in general that they stay silent and refuse to get involved. And with good reasons (in my opinion). So while you are screeching about racism because I pointed out the situation, THEIR CHILDREN ARE KILLING AND DYING! Imagine how the parents feel after going through so much to get their kids to a \"safer\" place. You think that you're defending them? You're not. You're perpetuating their pain. Well done.

It appears in entertainment at hotel luau dinners when other cultures of the South Pacific perform Tahitian Dancing and Fire Dancing under the guise of being authentic Hawaiian dance when it is not.  It appears in the way the word Aloha is 'advertised' and encouraged to be used in place of 'hello' 'goodbye'' 'I love you'  instead of it's true meaning which is embodied in the Aloha Spirit of the original people themselves.  It appears when the language is used inappropriately commercially for monetary gain.  It appears in daily life and day by day is getting worse with people taking sacred rituals to a new low adopting them into the new age movement and twisting them to fit into their own beliefs while using the original Hawaiian name for the label of their altered practices.

As the FBI proved two years later, several legislators were taking bribes. VECO got busted, the tax structure changed, and our share of profits increase by about four billion a year. We spent about half and saved about half. It is the savings we are spending down today. It took six years for the oil companies to buy our legislature back.

I'm speaking from experience, here, where a parish that I was a part of in the 70s began to focus on \"community\" and the actual Canon slowly became  the \"downer\" of the Mass.  Then the priest began to \"dress things up\", adding his own interpretation of the Words of Institution, the narrative, and even interpretive dance as part of the Eucharisic Prayer.  \nI'm not saying that this is bound to happen but, again, if the focus on the accidents of Mass, the substance can (not will) become of less import.\nI hope this clarifies my position.",

They are able to make the jump quickly because they already have sources of money and adequate name recognition. In rare cases, such as Elefante for instance, their interface with the community along with strong support from the outgoing member gives the probie politician enough heft to run a successful campaign. \n\nOverall, folks like Dudley and Case face quite insurmountable, but not impossible, odds.",

So how come companies can take pension contributions from employees, promise pension benefits and then just renege without any repercussions to the companies or their overpaid management?

Companies should be required to fully-fund their pension and severance liabilities (i.e. maintain assets equal to their liabilities and keep them separate from company assets) at all times.  As it is, if there's a shortfall in pension funding they are only required to develop a plan to get back to full funding eventually (they seldom do), and the regulators just go along with it.  As a former employee of a pension regulator, I was always amazed at this officially-sanctioned fraud.

The BCFN that have not been treated out can either settle treaties with the BC government or have it settled in the SCOC where the government has lost and will continue to lose or have the World Courts settle the dispute.

Go to the Alaska Department of Revenue website and find the Revenue Sources Book, which will show income from land sales.  Look at the RSBs for, say, the past five years to get an average of revenue from land sales.  Even if you could double the sales--which you couldn't--the revenue from land sales would still be woefully insufficient to close the budget gap.  Nobody wants to buy land that isn't surveyed, so the state would have to pay for that, and the state has other staff to manage sales so they're fair and legal.  Don't assume the state isn't constantly earnestly endeavoring to make money off state resources, incl. raw land (as well as oil, minerals, timber, water).

Her husband is her primary care giver.  Both are in their 80s.  The wife filed a petition with DHS to bring her sister to the US as a permanent resident to help with her care, but since it is for a sibling, the petition is at the bottom of the processing list.  Two requests to expedite processing were denied because the wife’s 100% disability did not meet DHS’s humanitarian criteria.  My friend appealed to Senator Schatz for help.

Balancing the risks is an important part of the decision to treat with antidepressants or not.

The Society expelled him not because he was an anti-Semite and Holocaust denier, but because he refused to accept what amounted to a silencing order. Apparently Williamson was punished not for his vile ideas but for his overly frank expression of those ideas.\nAnti-Semitism is on the rise around the world and in our own country. The neo-Nazi movement has emerged from the rock under which it usually hides; it has identified itself with the euphemism 'alt-right,' The alt-right, in the person of Steve Bannon, is poised to move into the White House.

The addict is still himself, the person you've always known . . . and yet he isn't.  A sort of shadow self seems to have taken control of his behavior.  As countless recovered addicts and alcoholics can testify, it's possible to close the door on that false self.  Most of them acknowledge that some sort of intervention was crucial to their recovery.

In fact, there is no reason that the target should be set as high as 2.0%. The 2016 renewal of the inflation control agreement admitted as much. A 2.0% target now is like a 2.2% target at the time of the 2011 renewal agreement. A move to annual basket updates in the CPI would push the effective target rate up even higher, where there is no need to go.

The end of the little Ice Age was not caused by CO2 emitted by the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Industry in those days didn't add any significant CO2 to the atmosphere. CO2 in the atmosphere was a fairly steady 280 ppm until about 1950 when it began to rise up into the present level of about 400 ppm. What probably ended the Little Ice Age was an increase in solar activity or a change in ocean currents.    \nThese same influences began the general retreat of the glaciers!

The delay could have been a number of problems, but when we book a flight, we need to also book our seats and pay for them , if necessary, to insure we will be accommodated. That cost should be factored in to the price of a holiday---reminds me of friends going on an African Safari and cannot afford the taxi home, so they call friends at all hours of the night!

Technically, they should leave after the Mass of the Catechumens.\nThe Liturgy of the Eucharist is a celebration that completely excludes certain sinners and tacitly admits others.\nChurch-going habits speak more of tendency rather than of attendance.\nIt is not just the young who look for a living, welcoming faith.

Depending on when you were hired, you were put into PERS tier 1 & 2 and OPSRP. As of Jan 1st, 2004 and going forward, all member contributions were put into their IAP, Individual Account Program in the OPSRP pension, which is basically a 401k, just like most employed Oregonians can get.  There are many factors that have contributed to the UAL (Unfunded Actuarial Liabilities). PERS members participating in variable investments during a robust market in the 1990's and early 2000's, the employer matching funds couldn't participate in those higher risk investments, huge baby boomer retirement and great recession.

It might bring a few ideas to mind how to manage their police services coming from Whittier.  The next point I'd like to make is that it is foreseeable during this period that an incident involving death or injury could occur, because of troopers and their \"non-response\".  The liability case(s) would go on for years in the courts; the expense and settlement(s) could be in the millions [as they usually are, to avoid publicizing details.]  It seems to me it would be cheaper for the troopers to just suck it up and agree to cover Girdwood for the two week interim.

These included raising the basic personal exemption, raising the tax bracket starting points, re-instating full indexing, cutting EI tax rates and the introduction of some credits.\n\nThere were also cuts to corporate taxes, but those only added to amount to about $5B/year.\n\nThe tax cuts added up to about $36B while debt financing declined by about $23B and spending, while shuffled slightly, was largely unchanged.

Kamehameha actively sought alliance with King George of England, and he and others spoke of themselves as men of Brittanee.

I spent a few years in apartments and I was heartily sick of having no yard, having to drag bags of groceries upstairs in the elevator and having nowhere to go but a narrow and unappealing balcony that was too small for a table and chairs! It's not for everybody although I accept that some folk love the freedom or have no choice. Canada is the second largest country in the world and there is no reason to be ripping up farmlands to build suburbs. If people want to live downtown then unless they have a pile of money, they're going to be stuck with high-rises but what are we going to do, bulldoze all houses and fill the lots with apartment buildings?! A better solution is what has already started to happen, a trend to smaller houses since many people live in houses far bigger than their needs would dictate.",

We are now expecting winds around 70MPH and no higher than 100MPH which is close to worrisome, but I've been through several 100MPH ones and they are not too bad. This is also great for Miami. I'm proud of Floridians as they are evacuating so orderly. If it turn out to have been unnecessary what is so bad about that - A few days off work and away from home is far better than pushing up daises. The winds for Miami are expected to be about 115MPH, easy for them but there is still a danger of high water so some of those people did indeed do the right thing.

I'll bet if 1000 people were polled throughout the State and were asked, \"What are the top 3 goals for Hawaii that we want to achieve in the next 10 years?\", there would be hundreds of different answers.  That is a problem. If you asked a sports team what their goal was however, they would all know the answer. I am proposing that if we all were working towards the top few goals, we would probably have a much higher chance of actually achieving them. Then we could move on to 3 more goals, etc... This would focus efforts, focus resources, focus tasks and timeline, and provide a collective sense of contribution and achievement. I would offer that doing something like this would make a real difference. Do we have any folks in our legislature who can make this happen in line with what you are suggesting?

Endangered species can't be hunted, so federal excise taxes (PR funding) doesn't even come close to the amount of federal money spent on wildlife conservation.\n\nhttp://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/how-much-did-the-us-spend-on-the-endangered-species-act-in-2012/\n\nAnd your argument that hunters also pay income taxes is a red herring.  Yes, it's likely that the average hunter pays more for wildlife conservation than the average non-hunter, because hunters pay the federal excise tax as well as for hunting licenses and tags.  However, hunters comprise less than 10% of Americans.  So non-hunters, as a group, pay far more than hunters in income tax, some of which is spent on managing wildlife in refuges, parks and other federal lands.",

Then he fixated on a friend of one of her friends and started sending her stalker, creepy, explicit e-mails to which she would reply F-off.  She finally printed them out and showed up at the door and tried to hand them to my room mate saying she needed to see what her so-called boyfriend was up to.  She just looked at the sheaf of paper and walked away.  After he totally spent all her money, he left her for another sucker.  I also met a male version of this type who lost everything.  Intensive counseling only works when the person admits something is wrong.",

So the shoe industry and others left.\nNow, as far as I can tell, the Republican Party is about enriching the rich, and protecting the investments of the investment class.

I read recently that every recession since 1920 something was preceded by rising interest rates.

And if you were born that way, does it not stand to reason that transgender people were also born that way? So, by extension does it stand to reason that these 'kid's aren't so much making up their own minds, but rather are trying to live with the inherent gender with which they identify? Does it not also stand to reason that the more a person tries to subjugate his or her nature the 'more screwed up' he or she will be in the long run?

The rate is too high as well, and of course a tax on revenue disproportionately harms certain types of low-margin businesses.
