Black got the Rockies to play to their potential for 3+ months and he was a great influence on the young pitchers. However, I would argue the Rockies are still closer to a .500 team than one that can challenge the D-Backs and Dodgers consistently. The Giants' complete trainwreck of a season cannot be understated when evaluating how it changed the NL West this season.  But I am thrilled we get at least one playoff game. As a guy who really thought 82 wins was the ceiling this year, how could I complain about that? And Bridich's moves--at least this year--worked more often than they didn't. It'll be interesting to see if a healthy Desmond has a Parra-like resurgence in 2018.",

It is precisely these reasons that I want to see it legalized and regulated. I'd rather isolate the problem to a few people who abuse it rather than throw in danger to children, black market crime, and gangs. I'd like to see the police focusing on bigger issues. Pot, compared to hard drugs, is minor - not to mention how much better it is for pain management and a variety of other uses.\n\nIf my father didn't have pot to manage his pain he'd go back to opioids and die.

The irony of shooting extremities is that hits will not reliably stop an attacker but can potentially kill them later. There are no safe places to shoot at someone to \"wound,\" too many large blood vessels can be damaged that can end up killing. It's also potentially a way to end up in jail. Lethal force, using a gun, is only justified by a lethal force threat.

Round that up to a $20 yearly fee. \nHow many cyclists are there? Do we charge a fee for every bike? A family of 4 who ride on occasion would pay $100 a year. How about transients? Do we confiscate their bikes if they don't pay the fee?\nIf we assume there are 20,000 active cyclists in the state that would pay the $20 fee, this raises $400,000 annually. \n$400,000 of $1.3 billion is .0003% toward roads, minus an admin fee. \nHow do we enforce the law?\nAt least cyclists could say they are paying their fair share. That may be worth it.",

Families in Asian countries often purchase housing for their kids to attend University in Canada, knowing full well that when their kids graduate their path to residency is assured.\n\nSecondly, a high proportion of foreign students have very poor english language skills.  That means that standards in Universities have to be lowered to graduate these kids, which means Canadian kids correspondingly also graduate with the same poor level of english proficiency because standards are so low.\n\nThirdly, there is little doubt that foreign students are displacing Canadian kids, particulalry in professional programs.

In academic and professional fields dominated by men, we are constantly told we have to correct the situation, and have programs in place to make sure the percentage of men in these jobs or programs is lower. Having more men participating in fields dominated by women does not seem to be an equal concern.",

They did this intentionally, & later on, 300s & after,  in order to supposedly protect the truth.  People do not destroy documents to protect truth - they destroy documents to hide truth & facts they don't like.  Women in Acts & in other documents led churches often in their own house with no other leader so they were pastors.  The apostles never told any women not to preside over Eucharist or not do anything else priests do.  There is a mural recently discovered that shows a women dressed as a priest clearly presiding over Eucharist in one of the earliest catacombs of Rome so that is more than suggestive to me.

Homogenous societies, societies made up of one distinct group with largely uniform beliefs, a mono-culture, tend to have less conflict and less violent crime, regardless of the national GDP.

Everything has become the responsibility of the government.  And we direct so much of our wealth in this direction and view successful business owners and the wealthy only as targets to further fund the situation. \nMy point is that while the article writer makes some good points, fundamentally our government and our society does not encourage risk taking.  With recent attacks on small businesses, its clear our government doesn't appreciate that providing incentives to risk takers is very much worth it to our society as a whole regardless of the ideological 'unfairness'.",

The area under the curve is now less than 240. The Earth must warm to push the curve “higher” to get the area under that curve back to 240. The combined bites and resulting warming increase the surface temperature to 288 K (15ºC). That 33 K warming is the result of the GHE. Now you can get a clear idea of each GHG’s effect by looking at its bite out of the Planck curve. The two that seem appropriate to this conversation are CO₂ and WV. WV absorbs at many different wavelengths, but not especially strongly. You can see this as all of the jagged, but not deep, bites over most of the curve. In contrast, the very large bite at 15 µm is from CO₂. Again, any bite out of the curve increases GMST. This should give you an idea of CO₂'s impact.\n\nhttps://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/gw-petty-6-6.jpg",

This is all public record and official policy. The Feds were essentially forced to step in to stop this obnoxious nonsense because it is so outrageous and against every value that ethical management agencies stand for. So, if the state would drop this wholly obnoxious policy the Feds wouldn't need to be involved. Until then someone needs to be a voice of reason.",

In fact, if there is any research at all left, it is likely that a company venture funded to sell potential product will fail.  Some start companies by selling the idea for a product.  If they are smart they can make a bundle from investors before the company fails as investors often cannot tell how far an idea is from being reduced to practice.  It is best start business only when the idea has already been reduced to practice and is ready to sell.",

The guide who greeted me indicated there was not one available. Thinking this was a matter of being a paying customer, I offered to make a donation. There still was no toilet available, a point impressed upon me by the manager, who directed me to a nearby Starbucks (which I had not known was there). I told her I was not sure I could make it to the Starbucks, but that did not sway her. Thankfully, I made it to the Starbucks and, though I had to wait in line for five minutes, the fact that I was no longer moving made it possible for me to hold it in. While I waited, I had a conversation with a lady in line about how ridiculous and potentially disastrous the lack of access to public toilets can be. This is a major public health issue.

Take away the 34 miles of the already existing Seikan Tunnel and it's still only $80 million a mile, or 84% cheaper than Honolulu rail, IF it comes in at $10 billion.  Only about 10% of Japan's land is arable, and in a country the size of California that has 130 million people, that makes the available farm land very valuable.  \n\nI traveled the route from Tokyo to Hakodate last year, and it definitely goes through valuable Hokkaido farm land, and I'd say that at least a quarter of it is in tunnels bored through mountains.  So I guess boring tunnels through mountains and laying seamless tracks capable of handling a 160 mph train is cheaper than laying conventional rails on defective plastic shims for our low speed driverless wonder in Honolulu?  Who would have thought?",

Blindness is a physical \"evil\" in that it is against the nature of the eye (and related systems).

The entire economy bears the cost of the polluter's selfishness.\n\nEliminating that subsidy unburdens the economy.\n\nIt is often argued that only rich countries can afford environmental law.

See a medical school biochemistry book for an explanation.\n\nAs they say, correlation isn't causation and just because aluminum is high in many Alzheimer's patients, it doesn't mean that the aluminum caused the condition.   Alzheimer is more likely caused by a combo of genetics and the impact of low B12 on metabolic processes in the body, with accumulation of metals (including aluminum in brain plaques) being a symptom, rather than a cause.",

These countries allow the private sector to provide primary health care in direct competition with the private sector.  This competition improves outcomes for patients and lowers costs.  Canada needs to follow Europe's lead if health care costs are to be controlled while at the same time improving patient care.",

Instead, Alberta has embraced the North American model of doing everything possible to attract private companies to extract the oil as quickly as possible, and used the paltry royalties they have collected to fund their government. \n\nThe result: Norway has over $1 trillion in their sovereign wealth fund ($235,000/person), and Alberta has $18 billion ($4,000).

The most recent factual flaw I have run across is the story that the oceans of the world will rise 10 feet in the next 200 years. This is because a specific ice shelf in the antarctic that even has a name will melt because of global warming. The big problem I saw was that this particular ice shelf is already under water and below sea level. When and if it melts, it cannot raise the oceans level.",

Could the pope on the basis of the keys claim that we can now consecrate pizza and beer at Mass?  Could the pope claim that that we can baptize and confirm animals? From your view is the authority of the keys a license for the pope to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants?  Are there no limits to the authority of the keys?",

We need a fair shake.\n\nAddressing our economic needs is a critical but unrealistic goal from weak knee legislators and greedy industries.  Our tax credits and reduced tax policies reward companies that lay off Alaskan workers and reduce in-state expenditures.

Instead we get rationalizations and minimization of the issue. \nMy take is that their position in the wider Muslim Ummah is too marginal for them to stand up and speak without fear of fatwa and persecution, from Saudi or Pakistan based Islamic teachers and followers.\nThis self censorship makes many Ismailis poor advisers for non-Muslims who wish to understand the challenges of Islamism, Wahabbism and Jihadi violence for our nations future.

Big Brother turns a well greased blind eye and lets Big Tobacco sell e-cigs, an untested product in over 7,700 flavors that kids like. One of the chemicals in e-cigs is diacetyl. Diacetyl is that \"buttery\" smell of microwave popcorn and causes \"popcorn lung\", irreversible lung damage. I really don't think the testing is about health concerns, but more about creating another state cash cow to milk.

Why was not the archaeology finished before construction started? It should have been done as part of the EIS, then all would know what was needed. Why were there big issues over HEI HV power poles too close? Why the big fight with the federal building? Why Rep. Cachola resistance? Why choose Ansaldo in the first place?  In sum it seems like this project was rushed to construction without adequate forethought and vetting. Some of the problems appear to rest with the original designer. Now the project has morphed into a design and build format. Now we pay multiple times for inspections during construction because of the misguided attempt to split the station jobs (we should have gone with Nan).",

Canada is at a big disadvantage in that segment to Airbus (subsidies from multiple deep pocketed governments) and Boeing (state and municipal tax breaks and big defense contracts). Maybe there is another successful niche in aerospace like the Canadarm down the road for us. It will be interesting to see how well the C series does.  Apparently, Boeing is at 46% of global backlog. If Airbus pushes them down to 40%, they will lock up global dominance perhaps for a generation. I don't agree with comments about the death of C-series. Why would Airbus build an assembly line for a program that intend to kill? One issue I haven't seen any comments on is IP ownership. Is that 50-50 also?

Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.\n\nAt the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of \"gay priests\" or \"straight priests\", but only priests as such. What good is to announce one's \"identity\" as a \"gay priest\" if that is irrelevant to his duties as a servant of God? That only exacerbates issues through the prism of identity politics and needless sensation.",

Even Keynes, who's name is used to justify deficit spending, was STRONGLY opposed to deficit spending during periods of economic strength.  His main contribution to economic thought was the notion of \"counter-cyclical spending\", ie government should spend during economic downturns and cut back during periods of economic strength.",

Despite what some have written here, organic yields are, on average, nearly as good (95%) as what industrial agriculture yields and - in poorer nations - often higher. Organic soils sequester more carbon than those found on \"conventional\" farms. Furthermore, animals raised organic are more likely to live in situations that avoid cruelty.

Contrary to what most people might think, police generally receive very little training on de-escalating situations, use of force, or in hand-to-hand combat. The result is they resort to guns much more often than police in Europe and other jurisdictions who are much better trained. Police in Japan are all expected to get their black belts in Judo, for example, and will go a long way to avoid hurting anyone. In North America police resort to guns far, far more than even they used to in the past. Check out a you tube video, for instance, of a White House intruder with a knife who wouldn't surrender back in the early 80s. No officer even drew their sidearm. They used batons to disarm him. Today's police training would have called for him to be shot the moment he came within 30 feet of a cop.",

From the War onward heavy immigration increased the labor supply and in low-skill work suppressed price of labor but the dramatic growth of US industry acted to increase the price of skilled labor.

Neither party was willing to compromise, but when Reid and the Democrats controlled all of the committees, there was never an opportunity to compromise via debate on the floor.  Over 70% of those bills had bi-partisan support, and would have been popular, but involved compromsing on some of Obama's agenda, and Reid wanted to protect Senate Democrats from having to take a difficult position on them by having to vote for a popular bill that Obama didn't want.  The Senate simply did nothing.  This is why the Swamp needs draining.\n\nOnce Reid finally resigned, Obama held his veto power over everything the House and Senate GOP majority wanted to do.  He wouldn't give an inch on his agenda.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/08/04/harry-reids-reign-of-paralysis/?utm_term=.372753d943d",

The way the law is headed an angry woman can ruin an innocent man's reputation, destroy him financially, and take away his freedom for a very long time simply by making a a baseless sexual assault allegation. I question if in this day age it is worth the risk for a man to have intimate relations with the opposite sex. If i had a son I would advise him to avoid relationships and  to focus on improving himself intellectually, spiritually, financially and physically. If he had sexual  urges I would advise him to look at porn and get it out of his system and then get back to self improvement.",

The church has a very very long way to go here, to even be able to demonstrate that the leadership \"gets it.\" \n\nStories like this on simply serve to highlight how large a gap remains, and how ineffective Francis, his group of cardinal advisors, and bishops across the globe have been in the face of this crime.

The operations of calculated destruction were set in motion.... I knew that the Jewish Quarter was densely populated with Jews who caused their fighters a good deal of interference and difficulty.... I embarked, therefore, on the shelling of the Quarter with mortars, creating harassment and destruction.... Only four days after our entry into Jerusalem the Jewish Quarter had become their graveyard. Death and destruction reigned over it.... As the dawn of Friday, May 28, 1948, was about to break, the Jewish Quarter emerged convulsed in a black cloud - a cloud of death and agony.\"",

Once she graduated, she came back to Canada.\n\nThe bigger issue, I think, is controlling the way some people come to Canada and live here just long enough to get Canadian citizenship, then go back to wherever it is they came from.  Their sole reason for having Canadian citizenship is to have an insurance policy to get them out of their mother country in the event the situation there deteriorates to the point things get dangerous.

In the wake of WW I, the KKK became a major political force in Saskatchewan amongst Protestants of British heritage who feared Eastern European immigrants.  An on and on as the circle of \"Old Stock\" grew, but its fear of newcomers kept reemerging during times of economic difficulty.",

For our existing politicians, it is always about being (re)-elected.\nThe development of polarized anti-immigration political movements in Europe and America followed the same pattern of conduct from establishment politicians.\nMany domestic voters are looking for vision, not voting bloc pandering, and it is very sad where that search ends up taking them.

Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was \"ekklesia,\" which means \"gathering\" and which came to be understood as the \"place of gathering.\" Its Jewish predecessor was the synagogue (essentially same meaning).",

The Australian government's own report uses some rather dubious statistical models to show a downward effect on the smoking rate:\nhttp://catallaxyfiles.com/2016/02/26/what-is-it-with-government-and-dodgy-regressions/\n\nMeanwhile, other jurisdictions that never introduced PP — like the UK and Canada — also saw smoking fall over the same period, in some cases falling more steeply than in Australia.

We should call on our government to radically reduce these numbers, especially in a time of soft economic outlook, soaring housing prices, and the strain on the social and physical infrastructures of our cities.

If working women in some countries comprise mostly professionals, they will rank better compared to men.\n\nBased on what is not said, I conclude that the pay \"disparity\" comes primarily from career choice rather than male-female pay differences in comparable jobs.  So I wonder, why do we want to manipulate women's career choices?  Paid maternity leave is really irrelevant in determining career choice and thus a red herring.  Why do we want to steer women into high stress long hour jobs instead of letting individuals make their own choices?  Nanny state.",

To enable small and weak persons to control those who may misbehave, the gun must be deployed, the great equalizer.  The substitution of the gun for physical control of bad situations has evolved to the shoot first and ask questions later police strategy.  After all, there might be some risk if police do not shoot first.  Alternative tactics could be deployed, but they are not.  Americans do not value life highly and that lack of value is not race specific.  The massive numbers of people incarcerated tells us much about how little we respect others.",

Hence, my invitation.  \nYou say that \"the entire issue of how much local law enforcement officers ought to co-operate with immigration enforcement was debated thoroughly in the previous decade, mostly relating to 287(g).\"  Not so.  The question was whether a State has the power to ENFORCE federal immigration law in the absence of an express federal authorization.  But, again, we're not talking about enforcement right now.  We're talking about State officers looking the other way when they know of violations of federal law.",

Perhaps if the City would create an actual entrance and exit to \"Laniakea Support Park\" that would help address the chaotic parking situation that has been allowed to fester.  A similar situation exists at the City Park land at Chun's.  I am not sure there are any other City parks on Oahu that are as wildly popular and heavily used that have no entrance/exit and no designated parking stalls.  It is strange that the Parks Department is so negligent at these locations given that the planning and Environmental Assessment work for both location were completed long ago.",

You'd have to be either a moron or imbecile to think that  they were only wiretapping trumps aides. It's pretty obvious who they wanted the Russian connection to be with,certainly not his aides. \nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html",

We can argue all day just what makes this girl behave this way, but one thing's for sure: It isn't because she's using her mother as a guinea pig. Enough of this \"testing\" nonsense. In life, there is cause and effect. The mother conveniently leaves out a possible cause. For all we know, Mama has been instrumental in driving away every single boyfriend the daughter has ever had. For all we know, Mama used to beat her when she was young or constantly denigrate her--and maybe she's finally getting hers.",

If Phillips had taken the beating Siemian was getting, he would have thrown his helmet down and layed into a few people. And Joseph should have done the same thing when that Ref made that horrible call against Thomas. Joseph should have also gave Thomas some grief for giving up on his route.",

As ambitious as the California legislation is, encompassing everything from routine checkups to dental and nursing-home care, its authors haven’t yet figured out how it will be paid for. The plan includes no copays, premiums, or deductibles. Perhaps that’s because the legislature’s own estimates suggest it would cost at least $400 billion, more than the state’s entire present-day budget. In fairness, legislators hope to recoup about half that amount from the federal government and the elimination of existing state and local health programs. But even so, the plan would necessitate a $200 billion tax hike. One suggestion being bandied about is a 15 percent state payroll tax.\nOf course, it is no surprise that Medicare for All would be so expensive, since our current Medicare program is running $58 trillion in the red going forward.",

By calling in early, like 2 weeks or 1 month, the city stated they would send an official out  to these addresses and talk to them warning them that they would be watched because of past complaints.  OK, I bit, I called in 2 weeks early with 6 addresses,  even sent pictures.  9pm July 4th, the Boomers started.  Between 9pm and 1am the Boomers continued.

Now I ask you if that happens to be the first fish you catch and you keep it how is that helping the resource?  I think the author is just trying to blame his lack of skill on someone else.

The developers always keep that for themselves to sell off years down the road. For example; a 1 acres lake front lot in the lower 48 sold for $6000 during the lake fill up period that took years and 40 years later sold for $450,000. The lake with 500 miles of shore line carries the local economy of the area to this day. Simply put, the value of the dam can not be measured simply in electrical costs. So when you look at the costs versus benefits, you have to look at both sides of the coin. If the dam is built; the displaced people should get a fair share of lake front as compensation in addition to what they get from eminent domain proceedings. And maybe free electricity for life or forever. You must also use the future value of the land for just compensation. Lake front is the $prize",

If a country can do more with less and meet their obligations, international and domestic, then what is the problem? If on the other hand, a country is spending so much on defense that their obligations in other areas- domestic and internationally, cannot be met, how is that not a problem? I do not have all the answers but I do believe that viewed as a question of values and respect, peace might be better achieved by means other than intimidation, threats and obliteration. MAD has saved us from ourselves for 72 years but that does not mean that it will be a sustainable course forever.  Years ago we were supposed to get a peace dividend, it never happened and we again are facing escalating threats of violence as the arms race mutates and metastasizes. Maybe a plan B is called for.",
