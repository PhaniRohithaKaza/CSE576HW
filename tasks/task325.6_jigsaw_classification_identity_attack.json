Da'esh want to kill all Shi'a Muslims.  I and my family are Shi'a Muslim.  It's therefore not a logical stretch for me to hate them.

In both cases, black witnesses flat out lied about what they saw and heard. Were the liars ever prosecuted for filing a false report or for perjury in court? Nope.\n\nKaepernick can take his \"protest\" and \"raise the awareness\" of somebody who believes all that black BS and gives a damn. I am tired of listening to black people bellyaching that they have to obey the law and comply with the orders of LEOs who are doing their job.",

The Methodists will get past this issue as well - long after most of the gay people have disappeared from the pews after having been driven away by homophobic sermons and condescending looks. In most churches the only gay people still around are the closeted, or in this case not-so-closeted clergy. These days most gay people would rather sleep in on Sundays.",

She is \"everything wrong\"? If it is that simple, it's good to know.\nBowers uses some big words in a flashy way that look like he enjoys writing.

Since then, this unholy creation has used the military power of governing systems to torture, slay, and beat humans into submission.  All the while claiming purity of soul and body with caring and compassion.  The dark side of this monolith continues today through brainwashing and physical assault by self-created messengers of a non-existent, invisible being.

The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

You know the Hate these people have and hold within that's taught to their offsprings. The Mosque's don't fool me, they have a hidden Agenda, the Spread of Sharia. Women's Rights Groups and the Snow Flakes jaws will Drop!\n\nJesus, couldn't teach them 2000+ years ago, What makes Americans or for that matter any Christian denomination tink they can change Islam/Muslim's Religion followers to assimilate into the Western World? A Religion that needs to be updated, times changed the World never ceases to Spin the game",

Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader.",

The second rape involved a 28 year old Moslem male who raped a mentally disabled white woman in August, 2016.\nInterestingly, these rapes have been downplayed by the Mayor and the police in Twin Falls, possibly due to the influence of Ulukaya and the growing number of Moslem refugees.

Oh really?  There have been asides for 30+ years  for Blacks in admissions to both undergraduate and graduate schools in almost all universities including the Ivy Leagues even when grades and SATS scores are less than white applicants.  Several Ivy League universities even put limits on orientals admissions as  a policy - only because they are better prepared and academically disciplined if the truth were said.

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Since the church still officially teaches that being gay is \"objectively disordered\" and \"intrinsically evil,\" thereby intentionally instilling shame in those so \"afflicted,\" few priests will ever admit to being gay if they still want to collect a paycheck, which the vast majority need to do in order to survive in this cold, cruel world. Even on National Coming Out Day (whenever that is) such a mass exodus from the priestly closet is highly unlikely. Now if the church were ever to change its tune in terms of doctrinal teaching then I suspect such an exodus is more likely, though it would probably begin more as a trickle  than a deluge.",

Perhaps its related to a long-perpetuated double-standard that when black or brown (or Muslim) criminals commit crimes, it's held up as a reflection on their entire communities, whereas when white criminals do so, it's only a reflection on said criminals themselves.  And that in turn seems predicated on a widely held and nearly as frequently denied assumption that was first voiced by satan, when his Creator demanded he explain why he refused to make humble himself before 'Adam as he was commanded: \"Anna khairum min'hum--I'm BETTER than him.\" (Qur'an, Suratul-A'raf, Ayaa 11-12)",

No... that is equivalent to me saying that a black man shooting someone is a Muslim attack.\nAnd shall we compare death tolls to your examples vs the daily attacks in the name of Islam? While I was writing this post, several people were probably murdered in the name of Islam for offenses such as apostasy or homosexuality. Do yourself a favor and start paying attention to the REAL concern of Islamic terrorism. Also, read the Quran a bit.. then study the history of Muhammed, a man who beheaded many, many people and also married a 6 year old girl. Then ask yourself why you are defending this religion.",

Monuments in ANWR and Bristol Bay will be upheld, under Supreme Court precedent, and the fact AK has no standing to challenge any monuments in its borders , under Alaska vs Carter (1980). It is the courts, not Congress, that determine the legality of actions by the presidents, in the case of monuments, the courts have upheld every monument ever challenged, including all 17 of Carters.

When Fish and Feathers employees do the culling, or the public is given permits, there is usually no distinction made between the Alpha's and other wolves.  Were clear photos made (remotely activated Go Pro's) available, the Alpha's could be identified, and spared.  A good reason for sparing the Alphas is that wolves are intelligent enough to understand that hunting around certain areas almost always gets some of their pack killed, and the Alphas then display avoidance behavior.  A lot of the culling takes place in the deep woods, where the Alphas can't get any clue as to why they are being killed, nor where there may be \"safe\" areas.",

We had that cruise missile ship that was damage  due to collision with a transport ship and needed 7 million dollar worth of repairs...was then sent to be mothball.  It cound have bee repaired in off shore facitilities...\n\nIts possible our alliance maybe costing us more than we thing because of interoperability that is all system must be able to communicate with our nato allis.",

The folks, in general, do not have the institution's hangups on married or women priests. The folks will realize there is a shortage of priests when their individual personal needs, e.g. anointing, funerals, etc, cannot be met.

When I attend the NO, I do not see this.  There are not many young people attending and the phones going off again and again say much about the level of mindfulness those attending this Mass bring to their worship.  For myself it is the TLM (and the music) that brought me back to the Church and the Sacraments.  It might not be entirely accidental that so little decent music has been composed for the NO.

The exception seems to be those who have sisters and have a better idea of being a part of a family instead of being a favored eldest or only son.\n\n\nThat, I think, is at the heart of the clerical problem, then magnified and concretized by being brought into a man-club with its bonds.

There is no rational way to compare who was more or less evil as the contributing circumstances are never the same and we cannot even agree on definitions. \n\nHere is a fact for you. In India its been known for thousands of years that the monsoon has a dry cycle. They adapted by producing excess storable foods like grains which they kept to feed people in droughts. British colonialists wanted profit and didn't know about the dry cycle. They switched most farms to cash crops like cotton and dismantled the storage (nothing to store). This resulted in 3 major famines before India's independence. The last one happened during Churchill's time. Over 30 million died, mostly children. Churchill refused aid 'they need to learn to care for themselves'  (despite that it was his empire that destroyed the ways they used to care for themselves). \n\nSo do we measure Churchill as more evil than Hitler?

There are people ready, willing and able to work past 65 but not that many get the opportunity. The other big issue is that there are some somewhat reasonable arguments that new graduates are having a tough job joining the workforce, I know for sure that in the high tech business, new graduates can't get their foot in the door because companies all want very specific work experience. IMHO, it's even more of a priority to get more young people into the work force than to have older people work on.

The feds can't be seen to give in to the provinces, and the provinces desperate for money would likely agree to anything. The problem for ordinary citizens, is trying to follow a money trail in government is impossible, and it is often impossible for those who job it is to tack government spending.

Partly because of the limited chatacters format.\n\nYes, there is a very close connection between the way the Eucharist is celebrated and the words and actions of Jesus at the Last Supper. I believe that very connection is represented by the three synoptic Gospel accounts plus Paul's, but that those accounts are already influenced by the way the community is celebrating the Eucharist.\n\nSo, for example, in your critical reading of Scripture you might notice that in the original Greek, Paul and Luke use the verb eucharistein, whereas Matthew and Mark used the verb eulogein. Anyone who wants to say the Gospel pericopes give us an exact account of Jesus' words has a problem explaining this difference.\n\nThe simple explanation is that these scripture texts are presenting the Last Supper in the terminology of how the community celebrated the Eucharist. There was unity in purpose and intent, but diversity of actual practice.",

It's high time that Bill Davis's folly to give funding to Catholic high schools was rolled back. To remove funding from Catholic elementary schools would be a bonus, despite the fact that it was enshrined in the British North America Act.  My son played rep basketball about fifteen years ago.  The out of town tournaments were held almost exclusively in Catholic high schools.  These were veritable palaces compared to his midtown public high school, which more resembled a gothic horror movie set than a learning institution, with its falling acoustic ceiling tiles, broken lockers and bathroom cubicles with missing doors. Why did this happen?  Because after 1985 so much money was siphoned out of the public school system to fund Catholic high schools and the parallel administration to the public high schools.  If Newfoundland can kick churches out of education, there is no reason Ontario can't!",

There's plenty of teacher tenure history that indicates that a handful of non-Native teachers worked their butt off to work with rural school districts and have succeeded.  Those that refused to stay and learn the Natives' culture and traditions bailed and returned back to the Lower 48.  The villagers didn't turn the non-Native teaching staff away from spite.  Quite the contrary.  If there's breakdown in communications then the villagers have the upper hand and can request the removal of the teaching staff that refuse to cooperate.",

No player was above suspicion, and at least on appearances you could presume that Mike Piazza, Roger Clemens, Rafael Palmeiro and many, many others were on the juice. There was no reason to assume Ken Griffey Jr., David Ortiz, Todd Helton and hundreds or thousands of non-household names were simply presumed to be clean or that no one cared about them.\n\nYet, only Barry Bonds was the devil. \n\nJust as only Colin Kaepernick is the devil in this situation. Jerry Jones and 30-odd other owners have no problem hiring known domestic batterers and probable steroid users, yet for some reason a player who expects better from the nation has committed a cardinal sin.",

Calculated on a per capita basis, using the working age population, Trudeau achieved a growth rate of 0.3%, the same as Harper over his period in of office. . Expenditure-based  real GDP per capita is still not back to its level in 2014Q4 nor is industry-based real GDP per capita back to its level in December 2014. So as of September, Trudeau had still not taken us from a recovery back into an expansion, although the 2015H1 contraction ended in June 2015.

Politicians and government agencies interfered (the SA CEF for example), set mad conditions, delayed and obfuscated. By the time they were vaguely organised (and its still a mess in SA today), the horse had bolted.  The low hanging fruit had been plucked (as had a lot of European countries), the 2008 financial crisis arrived and the not so ethical schemers, mainly towards Asia, were pretty much exposed.

The city wants a pools & parks bond, 4j wants a whooping levy, the country wants to renew the jail levy, and in the meantime the city wants to forfeit more general fund revenue by issuing more MUPTEs and extending the URD.

The biggest threat to democracy since WWII is the relentless march to the right wing under the rule of major international corporations that not only don't  want democracy but don't want sovereignty of nations to interfere with global corporate profits.\n\n  Demonizing large numbers of voters who want to change the rigged right wing economy and the corrupt political system is the oldest trick of ruthless leaders everywhere. Even in mild moderate little Canada, demonizing the NDP since its inception 60 years ago has been very effective in pushing Canadians ever more and more to the right wing under dishonest governments doing the bidding of greedy international billionaires.",

I am a 100 per cent innocent person,\" he tells reporters from a hospital bed, where he's held under police guard during a hunger strike. He adds: \"The last hope I have is [then prime minister Jean]Chrétien coming.\" A month later, Mr. Chrétien raises Mr. Khadr's case as he meets Pakistan's prime minister on a trade mission. He asks his counterpart to \"make sure respect of the laws and due process would be followed.\" Mr. Chrétien also meets the six Khadr children, telling the eldest he hopes the child grows up to be a Canadian prime minister. Mr. Khadr is let go weeks later. Within months, he starts to re-enroll his sons in Islamist military training camps in Afghanistan.\"\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-khadr-effect/article1124628/?page=all",

If you do have a Smart meter the cost varies from 8.7 to 18 cents/kWh. According to the Ontario Energy Board the average household uses 2/3 of their electricity during off-peak hours.  For San Francisco the 2016 average cost is 19.5 cents/kWh. What is not shown in either case are distribution costs and other administrative costs.\n\nSo electricity prices are not so low in the US they are higher than in Ontario.\n\nGasoline is another story. In Toronto we currently pay  about $1.09/L which is $4.12/gallon.  The US average for 2016 is $2.20/gallon. This is from the same data source.

There were plenty of qualified SURGEONS, but they were MEN.  In May 2016, an admiral with limited sea experience was appointed Commander of the 6th Fleet.  The sea experience was mostly in amphibious landing ships, but the appointee did spend a lot of time around the top brass at the Pentagon.  Oh, I forgot to say the appointee was female and black. Also in May 2016, a non-aviator was appointed Commander of the US Northern Command and NORAD.  Social experiments?  Political correctness?",

Mr. Briggs makes the mistake of thinking that a Council would take on the contentious issues of the day and be able to find a good solution for them.  Biggs forgets that the success of V2 was because it rose above dogmatic thinking (which is where we are today) and infused the Church with pastoral and restorative grace that too many current bishops and our past two popes never quite grasped well enough.

What do you suppose changed from the time he was governor to now when he is part of the trump admin that has vowed no one would lose their coverage under any replacement scenario. Good to see Lisa has joined with five of her GOP colleagues by putting forth an amendment to halt repeal of the ACA until March 3rd so that a real replacement plan can be worked out. After 50 votes to repeal and eight years of opportunity to develop a valid, vetted by the CBO replacement plan that will insure at least as many as now have coverage I doubt they can come up with one in the next couple of months but good on Lisa for at least acknowledging that a replacement needs to be on the table before repeal votes are taken. Gonna be especially hard since the ACA is the conservative plan of the Heritage Institute that Romney put in place in Massachusetts.",

Doing so would also smooth the way for Canada in its ongoing negotiations with Pacific rim countries and the EU regarding free trade deals.",

There was absolutely no compulsion whatsoever to be 'herded into the confessional'.\nIn college in Rome the practice was exactly the same, we clerics were able to go to Confession wherever and whenever we liked. Never in all the time that I was a postulant, novice or under vows was any pressure put upon me to go to Confession, either in my home country or in the heart of Christendom, Rome.\nFirst of all the provincial superiors of Religious Orders would be based in a single location and therefore unable to sit at the back of every house under their jurisdiction.

I said, you fool, this has got to be a hatchet job -- the reader can decide who was right).   \n\n Let's just take one little reported fact, seemingly small but crucial to Nigel's \"expose\" -- Nigel says, \"He has consistently failed to make child support payments and was arrested in 2013 because he was $9,000 in arrears.\"   Actually, Fred was never arrested.  The judge threw out the warrant, realizing that Fred had paid his daughter more than $100,000 for her college education, a new computer and other support.  This was a case of a gold-digging ex-wife making claims that were not true.",

Even among many of those Americans that are insured, they get 'basic' coverage, not the 'premium' levels of healthcare available to wealthy Americans.\n\nThe averaging of outcomes for key metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality, etc. reflects a large population of uninsured and under-insured Americans relative to a more broadly based coverage in Canada.\n\nThat being said, both US and Canadian healthcare systems suck big time when compared to most European countries and others like Japan, Australia and New Zealand.",

Europe is definitley cheaper, but also has serious problems with the EU. \n\nAt the moment I'm happy to collect cash from dividends etc, sit on 25%+ cash, and prepare for a rainy day when stocks will become cheaper.

My father slept at our house but mostly he was working or at the bar. Later in life, she considered divorcing him but he developed lung cancer and she decided to stay with him.

So, the government pays, say, an $80,000 salary, plus the employer's pension payment (Say $10,000).  Then the employee pays $10,000, it is true, but that comes out of pretax income, since this is a Registered Pension Plan.  But a private worker can use an RRSP to the same effect, so that is not a real difference - the difference is that the government worker is probably paid at least $10,000 more, and probably $20,000, in the first place. Taxpayers fund that overpayment.  If that is true then, indeed, the pension can be thought of as entirely paid for by the taxpayers.  \nThe larger point is that in assessing the fairness of public sector pay, including within education, health, ministries, and so on, you need to count all pay, benefits, perks, and the likely value of the DB pensions.",

Feel free to drill, and we'll tax what goes in the pipeline or onto a tanker, whatever.\n\nTaxes:  that's a tough one.  Sales or income?  If we go with sales, that means everyone, rich and poor alike, will have a stake in the state's well being.  Bad side of that is it places an extra burden on townsfolk that already have a sales tax, like Wasilla, Seward.\n\nIncome tax: Make it a flat tax.  I don't like punishing someone for being more successful than I.  Plus, you can deduct state income from your federal taxes.  That can come in handy!\n\nThere you have it.  Discuss.",

Sihota's Daughter was funded by a family friend, but the teachers who do this do it on their own dime. Says a lot about their pay levels and about the standards in Public versus Private Schools, doesn't it? A BC math teacher friend volunteered for the Accreditation Review at another BC Public School. He wanted to note that the math achievement was sub par, and that whenever they had a school assembly they cancelled the math classes, going below the prescribed hours of math instruction. There was no way for him to record either observation in the review. It was set up to give a fixed, no problem here, move along result.\n\nOTOH, someone we knew at a Private School viewed the process as life or death for their workplace. \n\nAlso http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/administration/kindergarten-to-grade-12/reports-and-publications/2010_factfinder_report_bcct.pdf",

And NO storage of toxic material is permitted in any place where it could be leached by groundwater, because ground water eventually ends up in the Great Lakes (which are thought to be the largest freshwater reserve in the world).  My problem with these new Alaska mine projects is that they do not actually plan to deal with toxins properly (no doubt due to cost).

Personal responsibility for compassion on individuals encountered by individuals has no relationship to compulsory aid via government fiat. In fact government takeover of such programs reduces the incentives & funds for individual assistance that communities used to employ to help the truly needy & shame the slackers. It seems to be your contention that a comprehensive government welfare system provides taxpayers with salvation and eternal life, a unique interpretation.\n\nIt's interesting how religious people must not be allowed to bring arguments from scripture regarding abortion, assisted suicide, LGBT, & marriage. But somehow scripture is just dandy to try to justify government confiscation of taxpayer dollars for the latest, greatest social programs that were unknown & irrelevant to the meaning of scripture now distorted to throw responsibility on government for charitable endeavors.",

Some are rewarded for other activities, or simply by the reputation they earned many years ago. Sometimes, like in any organization, there is favoritism, nepotism, etc.\n\nThe status of tenure is also changing with this new generation of faculty, as universities and colleges no longer have (and most can't financially sustain) as many tenured faculty as they once did. This coincides with the fact that the structure of higher education is also changing as online education is becoming more prominent and campus-based higher education is less necessary for delivering quality research and instruction to a wide audience anywhere.",

That is that the Kingdom of Hawai'i has been a neutral nation since 1843. This means that, under international law, the presence of a foreign military force, like that of the US, in the neutral Kingdom of Hawai'i constitutes a serious war crime.\n\nSome argue that Hawai'i was legally annexed by the US in 1897 after it backed a coup d'etat orchestrated by the 13 traitors of the white supremacist Committee of Safety. However the ratification of the Hawai'i Annexation Treaty of 1897 was rejected by the US congress on the grounds that the annexation of a Hawai'i by the US was illegal especially since a majority of Hawai'i's citizens signed petitions against annexation.\n\nThe US has failed to produce any evidence of the legal annexation of Hawai'i and, when challenged on the question of the legality of its claim, it remains silent.",

The other issues is adding weapons at Guam and Hawaii would require integration into our computer and intelligence network in California, Alaska, and Colorado which monitors and determines the firing of these weapons which has to occur within 10 minutes of our detecting an attack.",

I pray in the Name of the Son,  to God the Father Almighty.  The HS  is there with us in prayer,  but the HS never speaks about himself.   He never draws attention to Himself,  and all three ask me to respect the Holy Spirit.  That dimension  of God only wants to speak of Jesus Christ.  That is my experience,  which is also  confirmed in the Word of God. \n\nThe LORD always and only speaks to 'me through the Holy Spirit'  Believe it. \n\nHe Himself convinced me I have a deceitful, vain,  and untrustworthy heart.

Four days of sitting quietly in sometimes cold and rainy weather, can be pretty miserable.  To then go back to a tent is also pretty uncomfortable as well.\n\nThe only people that can afford this are trust fund babies and older individuals with sufficient monetary resources and there is a limited pool that want to participate given the restrictions.\n\nADF&G or the McNeill trust could build small cabins which would improve the visitor experience.  They have cabins for staff in remote areas all over the state.  At least when I was there getting fuel oil for cooking was a real pain.

Excess school buildings as a result of school mergers could be converted into public child care centers where necessary and others can be sold off to developers to be rezoned into new residential housing (another urgent Ontario need).
