I can't believe you would react to my post by trying to connect dots which do not exist in what I wrote i.e. coaching decisions and race??? Unbelievable.\n\nInstead that is a connection YOU created in YOUR mind while trolling. If anyone is implying racism it is you because your reaction suggests you think criticism of head coaches needs to be based on skin color.\n\nBy the way, last football season I questioned / criticized Helfrich numerous times on this site about his coaching and play calling decisions. So using your dot connecting approach, what type of racist am I? For me, I see head coaches, not skin color and my comments reflect that whether you believe it or not.\n\nPerhaps you saw the game and Taggart's coaching style from a different perspective and that is fine. However instead of trolling and reading issues into other people's comments  because it is what YOU want it to be, try posting your own comments.",

I get a kick out of the stupid statements Stock makes citing comments others have made during the heat of battle.

And one of the modern purveyors of this sickness is Princeton's Peter Singer, PhD, the so-called \"father of animal liberation.\"  This idiot argues that a dog is of greater \"ethical worth\" than a two year-old human child, and that therefore killing a CHILD is less reprehensible than killing a DOG.

Now that the Dotard needs to distract you from the likely fact that Putin holds kompromat over him, he’s instinctively raised tensions with NK. Now Trump must grope his feelings to discover how far he’ll go. With NK, we could communicate civilly; but he'd rather us irresponsible morons. In fact, peace and anti-hypocrite views would prevent us from murdering innocent people; but we don’t have the capacity to appreciate a human being’s dignity.

No, didn't think so.\nSecond, John Ibbistson should not be writing a piece promoting gay refugees over others without disclosing he himself is gay. Full disclosure John. Enough is enough. There are far more needy people out in the world that need Canada's help then homosexuals from a far off country.

When you can say \"look, I've been where you are and have felt what you feel\", you will have much more of an impact. When people act like this, it makes the world think this is Christianity. Just my 2 cents.",

Do you recall the impact of the July 2013 storm which flooded the subway, countless basements, and resulted in   massive insurance claims.  That was for 100mm to 125mm of rain over the GTA.  The 5 feet of rain in Houston is about 1700mm, or 15x that much.  Use you imagination and think what that would mean.  In a city full of valleys and ravines, the flooding would be unimaginable.  Houston's biggest asset and liability is that it is flat.  Flat means drainage is tough, but also that the water is not moving much.  So while the water is 4 ft deep, it is 4ft deep just about everywhere, and it is relatively calm.  In Toronto, the high ground would be fine, but the ravines would be roaring rivers of destruction.  I would bet the death toll from 5 feet of water in Toronto would be way higher than in Houston.",

Of course none actually examined it.  They took the word of Democrat hired private IT people (who took the fifth during congressional testimony).

It was painful for our daughter to be excluded, and the wait for Venture Scouting, which became available to her at age 13, felt like an eternity. We wanted very much to experience Scouting as a family, not as separate genders, and that appears to be true of many of our generational peers.

After the resurrection, St Matthias was chosen by the Church, and all successors of the apostles have been chosen by the Church.  Why is it that a woman cannot be ordained to ve a successors of the apostles? 2000 years not doing something is no justification for never doing it. Old habits die hard, but it is not a matter of faith.  It is cultural, a new issue that the Church had never considered before, but the Holy Spirit can get the Church out of this prison.

This should not be a surprise as \"corruption\" is the national governmental system, that rolls the national wealth into the accounts of a few of the traditional oligarchy and now the powerful military. The dictatorship was conceived in the US embassy, and is sustained with support of the embassy, not out of any love for Hernandez, the dictator, but because he is dependable and supports the huge US military presence in the country, including the largest airport Palmerola. The coup had the blessing before its execution by Cardinal Rodriguez, who with the leader of the evangelical union, both receive a $5million stipend directly from the presidential office.

Children are not widgets, each one is an individual that is unique. The one size fit all programs that the districts/state/feds have adopted are a major problem. At one point the districts encouraged teachers to try unique things to engage students, know they sit the students in front of a computer and have them work on individualized computer programs.

The correct word is \"Crown\" not \"settlers\".  The settlers word seem to have chosen by some indigenous people who come across to me as a  use as a slur.   Indigenous peoples  have demanded more appropriate language to describe themselves.  That is fine and appropriate.  I have read one or two of these treaties. Treaties were signed between the Crown (king and now Ontario's government)  and Indigenous nations and tribes.  These treaties were not signed individually with each European pioneers.  Depending on the era from Upper Canada to Ontario pioneers bought the land from the Crown. The Crown bought the land from the Indigenous people as outlined in Treaties.",

It doesn't mean the capitalists have taken over or Harper is coming back. All the pinkos on this site can just relax. It is just a good product that works. If you don't like it or have 50 reasons why it will be bad, don't buy it.  But it is a good product and you are just wrong on this one.  No I don't work for them or anyone who sells them. I'm a random dude who likes the product and wants to offset all the people on here who don't have one - but have an opinion.",

The F-22 production line was shut down by Obama in 2012.  The cost per flight hour of the F-22 is over $62K/hr.  The US shut down that line because the F-22 is too expensive to fly in quantities that would be useful.  THEY are buying the F-35 instead.",

The real metrics com from average cost per person to get health insurance if they choose and their ability to actually pay that amount.   The ACA has made that much more difficult while a repeal would make affordable insurance easier to actually afford.   \n\nYou are right though the utter mess of healthcare goes way back to when a president STUPIDLY attempted to impose wage controls.

I'm so sure that someday, after every mining company has had a chance to write off 100% of their Pebble exploration budget, under US federal Mining law, that it will be called a renewable sustainable ore. Sort of a magical ore regrowth under the surface of the ground. \n\nBasically anything goes with the Pebble prospect, because they haven't submitted a plan. Sorry, but Pebble ain't THAT special. More money of made (and written off on US taxes) for exploring and scamming for ore, than the actual commercial extraction of it.",

Depending on the type of animal, depends on the method of dispatch. Once the animal is stunned & thus rendering them unconscious & brain dead, they will NOT feel any pain and will not recover. It's done quickly and painlessly. Then, their throats are cut & they are bled out.  They feel NOTHING so stop with the anthropomorphisms. The RBB&B Circus had NEVER been found guilty of actual abuse to the their animals.  Abuse is NOT an opinion, but has a legal def.  I knew many good folks who loved for & cared for their elephants.

Part, but not all of the cost overruns are due to increased construction costs and bids higher than expected.  There are several ways to protect against this.  One of the ways in the article is to tie the revenue stream to high construction costs.   That is one of the reasons an optional property sales tax is proposed in the TOD Zone.  This tax would take time to get online, but once done can be significant.  That is why revenue options need to be in combination.  If more options come online, even the excise tax extension, with reduced burden, could be eliminated. Option 2 in the article. However the excise tax is powerful, because tourist share in the burden.  With increased visitor arrivals this is an important source.  With rail to Ala Moana, more tourists would use it, say to visit new TOD stops, or go to Pearl Harbor or Aloha Stadium.   Thanks everyone for comments.!!!  All needs to be addressed.

Some couples do not want children.  Women need to plan their families to accommodate education and careers and to assure the family can provide opportunities for children to have productive lives when they grow up.  There is no need to limit sex in order to manage fertility when contraceptives make that unnecessary.  LGBT couples can have children through IVF or surrogacy or even (scary) new techniques that replace one set of DNA with another.  \n\nThere is a lot we need to think about that never had to be considered before.

Unlike the cheap, slow responding and hard-to-see chemical disks folks often buy and stick on the dashboard as an afterthought, the electronic monitors have quick response times, loud alarms, and flashing lights.  I carry a small \"Pocket CO\" on my keychain.  To me, the $140 or so that I paid for it is well worth the investment in the safety of myself and my passengers, and the peace of mind that it brings while flying is priceless.\n\nDeepest condolences to the pilot and family.

Extending the faculty to absolve the sin of abortion and the consequent excommunication to all priests will, I hope, result in many women seeking and receiving absolution and returning to full communion in the Church.

Not only is inexperience a factor, there is also the way coaches get conservative in their playcalling because of it.

With no running game to help that pretty much limited them to dink and dunk full time.I hope Joseph will have the offense pay more attention to the deep ball. Which ever QB can hit a receiver in stride 20 yards down the field should be the starter. I care less about dink and dunk and completion percentages.They couldn't even get first downs. There comes a time you just have to let the guys play. I know the pressure is on coaches to win but you can't hurry development.

It was really interesting; and his humbleness is something we don't see a lot of in the current political atmosphere.

(I don't say that to normalize it, but to make people aware of their own actions and words.)\n\nHere's my understanding. If, out of a sexual motive, you apply (or threaten to apply) physical force of any sort to someone without their consent, you are liable to a charge of sexual assault. For example, a patron in a bar might be sexually attracted to someone they don't know, and grab his/her bum on the dance floor. That's sexual assault, although the typical consequence is to be ejected from the bar rather than charges being laid. So yes, I believe that it is routine for people to speak of committing sexual assault, although they would probably deny that what they did or were contemplating was an offence.\n\nAs for more serious forms of sexual assault, no- I've never heard someone talk of committing it.",

But commuting into Paris is still difficult, roads, freeways and commuter lines are packed. \nHere in Vancouver we live 10 minutes from downtown, transit is excellent as long as one is not too far from the center. We rarely drive and fill up four times a year. High density makes it possible to have efficient transit.\nThe post war expansion of the suburbs has been a disaster in terms of mobility, pollution and wasteful use of land, but the development industry would carry on building on farmland farther and farther out if it was allowed.",

Here, an observed but unidentified causative factor seems to influence the long term cycles of super storm activities. That said, scientists have also observed the following(from cliffmass): \" As air warms it can \"hold\" more water vapor, which can lead to heavier precipitation as the air enters a storm and rises.  In fact, more water vapor can also help rev up a storm as well, since when it condense it releases \"latent\" heat.\" He agrees a 1 degree C temp increase in water results in a 7% increase in rainfall.

Having Amazon move here would be a catalyst for what is already a growing technology sector and will strengthen our economy for at least the next couple of decades.  Some rave about manufacturing jobs but what people don't seem to see is that the jobs that companies like Amazon bring have the multiplier effects that manufacturing once had.

Amongst the controversies was what amounted to wire tapping by the Ferrari team - a practice that had long been suspected but which was now confirmed.\n\nIt was put to one of the Williams engineers that they might have done the same if the boot were on the other foot. He said no, Sir Frank Williams calls the team management in at the start of every season and tells them what his team will not do. It doesn't matter if others do it and prosper, the Williams team does not do these things.\n\nThat's leadership. \n\nToo often these days - in business and in politics - leadership is reactive.

Their different reported results arguably reflect whether the questions asked measure general preference (which nets higher NDP support) or stronger intention (which nets closer results).\n\nFirms this year are also stressing preference differences by voting age.\n\nConclusion, the 2017 polling snapshots are accurate (but each firm measures slightly different things) and these snapshots all imply that whether young voters turn out (or not) will decide who wins.",

If Side A truly understands Side B's perspective, then Side A can produce Side B's position with such accuracy that Side B recognizes it as their own. In fact, Side A almost invariably produces a caricature that Side B rejects, but Side A insists is absolutely true. And the same in reverse happens when Side B attempts to produce Side A's position. \n\nWhen that happens, a dispassionate third party would fairly conclude that the two parties do not in fact understand each other. \n\nIMHO, discussion with a view to passing the test is useful.",

Each of the charges appeared about a week after I rejected the merchandise right at the in-store parcel pick-up desk and directed it be returned.  An additional 9th charge appeared out of the blue entirely.  Now, Sears insists it will take them 6 - 8 weeks before I am credited with the money they charged me.  I smell a scam, possibly an inventory liquidation prior to bankruptacy later in January, and I fear that I will never see my money?

Since he reportedly intended to kill Jews, there's already good evidence that he was targeting a specific group, so the implication is there.\n\nHate crimes can be pretty hard to pin down, but they should be investigated where evidence exists because often there is an underlying wish to inspire others to engage in the same sort of actions.

Because the Isrealites did not decimate all of Canaan to the last woman, child, and oxen as God instructed. So there is definitely support for \"killing\" in many parts of the Bible.",

And this goes both ways along the left-right spectrum. It is not unreasonable to suggest that there is a 'strain' (Cassandra is careful not to say that 'most' or 'all' conservatives are part of this strain) of conservative politicians who both share and rely on some voters' disdain of the immigrant 'other.'  She may be wrong but it's not a form of hatred to make that argument, nor to suggest the possibility that Harper was indeed being strategic (after all, he pulled the immigrant stuff out of his hat fairly late in the pre-election period, knowing the polls were what they were).",

The site has mocked LGBTQ people, feminists and women, denied the existence of climate change, insisted that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood, and served as a propaganda arm for the Trump campaign. Bannon has also promoted anti-Semitic conspiracies about a globalist cabal of bankers, media figures and other elites working together to oppress U.S. citizens.>>\n\nBannon became CEO of Trump's campaign on August 17, and it made headlines.

The only thing gun control laws will do is keep law abiding people from buying guns .  The night of the shooting in Vegas over 150 million American gun owners hurt no one .  So far , from what we can tell , the Vegas shooter would have passed any back ground check that would have been given to him.  People snap---no gun background check can stop that. That's why Kelly and his wife are clueless on the issue .  What has been the latest killing tool of the crazy and terrorists ?  Cars and trucks .

By that time (50 AD) all the Epistles (primarily Paul's) had been written down.  And there is good reason to think that The Gospels were written in conformity (to a greater or lesser extent) with Paul's epistles and, consequently, among other reasons, there is good reason to think that not everything in all The Gospels is factual.

The months and days of the Julian calendar were used, the year starting in March.[2] However, in 1256 AH the difference between the Hijri and the Gregorian calendars amounted to 584 years. With the change from lunar calendar to solar calendar, the difference between the Rumi calendar and the Julian or Gregorian calendar remained a constant 584 years.\n\nSame calendar we use?

Combine the sure destruction of the lower middle class by cutthroat capitalism as it moves manufacturing to Mexico and China, and the loss of the ability of the Democratic Party to help poor whites as unions weaken, and Trump emerges as the only Republican championing them. \n\nKind of weird that a billionaire is the one who gets how lost and afraid poor people are, who gets that Americans have awoken to the lie that business cares, that politicians represent them, that the future is anything but a bleak fight for dignity and hope.\n\nSure, I will be voting for Bernie, but I understand Trump's appeal. Don't mistake it for something temporary. This American ship is sinking, and terror leads to grasping at any straw.\nHugh Massengill",

Subsistence limit is now 5 Caribou/DAY.

Online, you get to be anonymous and cowardly. Kids can't process this, even though they think they can. And yes, kids do need to tell an adult when these things are happening. For most, this type of abuse is way out of their wheelhouse. Schools and public institutions need to screw how they look and do their jobs of helping our children.

The higher the income of an individual or corporation, the more they benefit from government services.  Why?  Because they generate profits based on it, which far outrun the value of mere wages.  The conservative view on this is incorrect, because that view is based on a flawed definition of \"consumption\" of government services.  The real indicator of consumption of government services is who is generating excess discretionary income.  And that means, yes.... gasp.... the wealthy should pay more taxes, because it is in fact the wealthy who actually consume more government services.  One of which is an education system that provides skilled labor off of whom they generate additional profits.",

ACES was doing just fine and we were able to set aside $17 Billion in the CBR. It was doing so well in fact that Parnell campaigned on keeping it in place. He lied of course as politicians often do and by April of the following year the entire tax structure that had so benefited Alaska was thrown out and replaced with the enormous gift to the oil industry. As he signed the bill into law Parnell warned about the massive loss in revenue it would cost the state and called for belt tightening to make up for the loss.

When a number of my co-workers had issues at work they'd tell management not to tell the union. They trusted management more . The day I retired I told the union to not contact me again and stop sending their newsletter.

The resolution is biased in favour of Israel because it imposes no consequences on Israel despite its decades-long contempt for International law. Not only is the resolution toothless, but it also ignores Israel's other egregious human rights violations, including its rampant abuse of Palestinian children: https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/11/palestine-israeli-police-abusing-detained-children.",
