We have a huge trade deficit in dairy products with the USA which gives us the upper hand in any negotiation.  Blather about supply management aside, which is a deep and thorny problem, beset with various ideological underpinnings, and both pros and cons, the situation boils down to this.  We are in a price war with US dairy suppliers on 'skim milk' or 'ultra filtered' milk.  If the US decides to sanction us on our skim milk, we need only place a retaliatory tariff on their skim milk.  American dairies will lose much more business than we will, and conversely, Canadian dairies and farmers stand to gain that business back.  Perhaps my logic is too simple.  Please let me know.",

Where does the graph data come from?\n\n-\"Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year — enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.\" Given that sea levels are set to increase by 2-3 feet by 2100 (not 30 feet \"in the near future\" as Al Gore claimed), this will make a difference of an inch or two by 2100. Also, recent studies suggest that weather is not getting more extreme, but less extreme in recent years.(2)\n\n-despite China emitting more than double (29.5% of global emissions(1)) of what the US emits, they are not obligated to start reducing emissions until 2030 or later. This is simply ludicrous, especially when they already have a huge trade surplus (i.e. competitive advantage) w.r.t. to US and most other countries, on account of their manufacturing",

If unanimous verdicts were required, a defendant would benefit from a hung jury with 10 of 12 voting to acquit, because if the prosecutor polled the jury and found that 10 people voted to acquit, he would be unlikely to re-file charges and go to trial again.\nIf a jury votes 10 of 12 to convict a person, it means that the prosecutor has failed to prove his case \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", because the two people voting to acquit had enough reasonable doubt to acquit. Since a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty (beyond a reasonable doubt), a person in this case should still be considered to be innocent. In that case the prosecutor has the option of re-filing the charges and trying the case again.",

Most readers probably assume the real cost is $4 and the cab company is a rip off. The truth is that the fares charged by Uber only cover 42% of the cost of the ride. The rest is funded by their investors. This means fares will eventually go up substantially  once the competetion has been crushed by artifically low subsidized rates, unless Silicon Valley investors somehow decide to subsidize cheap rides in Anchorage forever.",

This led  to Obama trying to disown him so that he could be president.   At least some people at the time did not believe that Obama could be associated with that pastor and not pick up some of his beliefs.  There are others in his past that he associated with that were that way.  I suspect that are similar ones that he associates with today.",

There is a clear difference between this construct and the 90's independence movement, in which some extremists argued that all non-Hawaiians should be forced to leave an independent Hawaiian government. \n\nThrough the reorganized Native Hawaiian government we would not be a new state or replace the state. We would not have the authority to change your rights under state and federal law,and definitely not to kick people out of the state!

There is ZERO evidence that China has any interest in militarily attacking Canada, the US, Europe, or large parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Like the US, and previous global empires such as those of the UK, France, the Incas, Turkey, ..., China wants to become a regional power that can keep its own regional empire safe. It is more likely to use economic than military means. Those people who raised issues about Chinese takeovers of such Canadian technology companies might want to look in the mirror, and ask themselves why they are so afraid of China, yet somehow are happy to have the US takeover the same companies. Given water and energy issues, we are far more likely to be attacked militarily by the US in the future.",

They also deserve to retire someday and maintain a reasonable proportion of baseline income as all retirement strategies recommend and target.

Rather its MER is just its own cost which is subtracted from the net returns of its constituent elements to determine the subscriber's return on his investment product that invests in other investment products.

I do pray there, and the general work of gardening, the thing itself, is offered as a sort of prayer, but it is not dedicated to any particular saint. It's intended for the people living in the immediate vicinity. At the moment, there are six people/families that are growing vegetables, my wife's flower border, open space for children to run around, a few benches, and a low tree-house/platform, also for the young. And a drinking fountain, near the center.  I don't  consider it mine to name or dedicate. For me, I think it mostly serves as  a God-in-You garden. A priest-friend told me I ought to have a figure of Mary out their, and that was nice to think about. I thought that if there was it would best be in the form of a mosaic, composed of some of the too-abundant glass, pottery, tile and etc. that comes out of the ground here. I could do such a thing, but in a way it seems redundant, and there are other tasks to attend.",

Canadians were able to submit a formal opinion survey on the long list, twelve nominations who were chosen by the council, to gauge their decisions.  The advisory council also submitted a short list of five nominees and did focus group testing of those five to see what the reaction would be.  This short list of five choices was then submitted  to the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Minister of Finance.  The Minster made the final choice.  \n\nNowhere did we vote for anyone on the bill.  We were given the ability to submit an opinion survey on twelve nominees already chosen, not of the entire list.

Trump, like all of us except maybe Mr. Haske, knows that's how politicians operate. This last round Trump took full advantage of that laying out a list that excited some and frightened others. The fright crowd is interesting as it is like \"phantom pain\"...or in this case \"empathetic fear\" for those here illegally. The Wall, the Family Deportations are 2 examples I don't think will be implemented as described. \nLike the Democrats who switched after 50 years and voted Republican...\"it's the economy stupid\" that sunk the SS Clinton and it was the Wall that brought out the law and order voters.

I don't think the problem is with the conservatives that want to cut the budget; the problem is the forces behind a big government workforce and big government spending.

One problem with that here is too many roads in Anchorage (e.g. Turpin between DeBarr and the Glenn) with perfectly nice bike lanes had some #()&% planner decide the bike lanes should temporarily end at every intersection and with the roadway literally closing in by curbs bicyclists should be forced to zip onto the sidewalk to go through a crosswalk and potentially get broadsided by a car not expecting them, and to zip back onto the roadway after the intersection.\n\nSomebody doing stupid is not an idiot driver, idiot bicyclist, or idiot pedestrian.

The problem exists on both \"sides\". But I have found most people take a more nuanced view. I know many people who attend both the Extraordinary and the Ordinary Form regularly.

Therefore, we may say that the fetus \"prefers\" to continue the pregnancy and will not/cannot take a different initiative that affects the ethical outcome. (A spontaneous abortion is not an initiative.)\n2. Stakeholder #2: the woman is subject to conflicting forces, some of which incline her to carry the fetus to term and some of which incline her to terminate the pregnancy.  Since the actual decision is eventually hers, the question is whether the negative factors can (or should be) neutralized.\n3.

The library is not sruffy. And there are many NEW STORES and restaurants ON the Ave, which are not scruffy. As a long-time resident of the UD, I can say that 95% of the UD is NOT scruffy.

When they try to sing a Catholic tune, they are off-key.\n<That said, the \"fringe\" exhibit certain traits: ostentatious religiosity, anger, fear, paranoia, homophobia, political fancifulness, and, in the worst cases, misanthropy and detachment from reality.>\nThese are the characteristics of religious fundamentalism across various religions and denominations. Fundamentalism is, in many respects, not so much a theological deviancy (although it is that) but a psychological deviancy.\n<<\"[Baum] was the most charitable and optimistic person I've ever known,\" said Hinsdale.>>\nYes, that speaks volumes.",

Calling this girl \"immoral\" instead of saying she had immoral behavior is, IMO, judgmental.  The social media harassment is definitely judgmental.  Attacking & condemning a person, rather than actions, & treating as if God doesn't love them is judgmental.

That is, our will and our intellect do not have total dominion over our passions, appetites as a result of the First Bad Choice.\n\nPeople dispersed across the lands and over time (spurred on by the implanted desire for God) formed various shared understandings about God.  Some of these understandings were closer to the truth than others.\n\nGod enters time and space in different ways.  He's a fairly efficient Being! [I think He's the Divine Engineer, frankly].

Bye!\"  You would be cool with that?  \n\nOn the other end, if I hire a DJ and tell him I want to use him for 10hours for an event, and then on the day of the event I say to him \"Nevermind, I dont want you to DJ the event anymore\" - should the DJ who has possiably rented specific equipment for your event, or hired staff or passed on other jobs just say \"ok!\" and be done?",

IF he did this , is the public at risk by his stupidity ?  With most of the media liberal--does one really believe this hasn't happened with them?",

The City has taken it for granted that a water shortage at the end of summer is no big deal, because winter will provide, but climate change has already had a significant effect on CT - we no longer have a Mediterranean climate. When my mother grew up here, winter rains meant two weeks of solid drizzle, then a day or two of clear weather, then two weeks of solid drizzle, etc - right through winter. I've lived in CT for about 30 years, and I've never seen that. We're now getting rain much later in winter, and much less of it, and we're getting the odd storm right into November. Overall, we're getting much less water out of the sky, so we have to be much smarter about how we use it.",

There was enormous international solidarity, empathy for people forced to flee murderous countries like Pinochet's Chile and Botha's South Africa, education for refugees etc.\nBut of course none of that is mentioned in the cheap, commercial museum near the TV tower, so Greg wouldn't know.\nA thorough article might have looked at where the GDR links are visible in South Africa today - both positively and negatively.

The Mission is not equipped to work with the mentally ill and is will not accept individuals who are \"under the influence\" or drugs or alcohol.

There are certain themes that resonate very well in Alberta, even among some young people.  This was affirmed in spades 19 months ago.

How much lower can our Republican lead Senate drop to? \n\nI have no kids to educate nor do I have any family or anyone I know living in a Pioneer Home (so I have no stake in this), but I do know that I am willing to pay into a progressive income and/or sales tax within a balanced plan to insure that seniors are housed and that your kids are educated. \n\nThis is about creating a common sense, responsible, balanced, and compassionate Alaskan society for all, not an everyone for themselves, statewide dystopia. \n\nThis is not fiscal responsibility; this is fiscal idiocy.",

Dr. Williams has gathered a considerable amount of unimpeachable evidence in his research of Hawaii's history surrounding the \"overthrow\". The evidence proves that the members of the Committee of Safety were blatant and unapologetic white supremacist racists who believed that, as a non-whites, Hawaiians were inferior subhumans that were incapable of governing themselves, despite having done so for thousands of years, and that they needed white men to govern over them.\n\nThis attitude is typical of the white supremacist racist ideology upon which America was founded.",

Why not honor our hopes for the future by making the statement today. \n\"Our culture no longer tolerates racism and slavery and stealing of lands of native peoples\".  \nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

Warm LEDs have won me over - but when considering the light in my home, there are many things more important than efficiency - and I suspect I am in a comfortable majority here.  We'd all love to be more eco friendly but the cost cannot be our mental well being - cold light will never feel right no matter how eco friendly it is.  There are other things that fall into this category - just because something is \"good for you\" does not mean you will embrace it, it must be as good as what is being replaced for wide spread adoption to happen.",

A double-threat QB that can take off and scramble when protection breaks down can help counter the pass rush, but Trevor is weak on scrambling ability. He also stays locked into a receiver too much, and is slow to read and react.  \n\nUnfortunately our other QBs may not be much better in those areas.  But at this point I think we just need to make the change, because this combination clearly isn't working.  The main problem remains the bad OL, of course, but we're pretty much stuck there.  At QB we can make a change.  I'd give Oz the start for the next few games.

Fracking means more oil production which has mean more natural gas which is far cheaper than coal. In 10-15 years I'll bet solar and wind will provide more energy than natural gas. Nat gas, solar and wind are cheaper than coal. What's wrong with consumers paying less for energy?  Heck, even the coal museum in Kentucky recently converted to solar!

Beginning in July 2002, Ben Stevens held a secret option, expiring in December 2004, to buy a 25% ownership in Adak for an immediate payment of $50,000 and another $450,000 paid over time. In mid-2004, 50% of Adak was sold for $4.3 million to a Seattle company. Adak Fisheries paid Stevens $295,000 between 2000 and 2004. The Aleut Corporation attorney, Roger DuBrock, said in a deposition, \"My concern is that if it ever became public knowledge that Sen. Ted Stevens got legislation passed for a pollock allocation that ended up getting assigned to Adak Fisheries, and that Ben Stevens, his son, had an ownership interest in that company, there would be all kinds of unfavorable newspaper reports written that might damage Senator Stevens and might damage Ben Stevens and might damage the Aleut Corporation.\"",

This idea that the citizens will somehow gain more power as a second class city is being put forth by a group of people who are so fervently focused on a single issue that they are not examining the facts, and either can't or don't want to understand what it means. First of all, the very right that we citizens now have which allowed them to put this on the ballot in the first place will be gone. No more citizen led initiatives. Also, we will be obligated by State law, under a series of one-size-fits all laws that apply to second class cities with little regard to local issues. Regarding city council, we have the opportunity to replace four out of seven seats in the upcoming election, that is ample opportunity to vote on the issues that concern you, the move to replace the city council is unnecessary. This measure is a scorched earth attempt which will set us back decades.",

The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that alcohol is an acceptable part of our culture -- especially within Catholicism -- and pot isn't. When abused, both substances can be destructive.\n\nIf the bishops want to teach about the virtues of moderation and temperance, I fully support them.

After all those years when they decide to spend their advertising money someplace else , you Iditarod fans attack them like a pack of rabid dogs. How pathetic.Their bank and money was good enough for you all those many years  , now all of a sudden it's not ? You didn't complain about their logo before , but now that they aren't giving you free money , they are to be mocked ? That's the typical Alaska handshake---where the hand comes out with the palm up expecting money or else. I hope all sponsors will take note and drop their support of the Iditarod because it's clear they will turn on you too. As a member of NBA , like thousands of others I kept with that bank when they became Wells Fargo. They are a great bank with the nicest people working for them. Those that did wrong were fired .IF they did drop sponsorship because of the dog deaths---good on them.  Forcing dogs to run a 1000 miles is sick.",

God will not come in Peace when he arrives, he will make the EARTH SHAKE.

ANC has had the worst of both worlds: stupid Republicans who thought that if they gave unions what they wanted the unions would like them, and Democrats who gave unions what they wanted because that is what Democrats do.   The MOA government is of, by, and for its employees; you only get to pay for it.",

Some investigations cost a Board over $30,000 and produce let's say a $5000 fine.  But the fine does not go to the Board, it goes to the State. In many cases the licensee that is being investigated by the Dept. has already been convicted and fined in criminal court. So how does the State spend $30,000 to investigate something that has already been investigated and facts determined, tried and convicted. The system is being milked to the point of potential fraud.

Gravity waves are similar in concept to electromagnetic waves, i.e. radio, light, X-rays, etc.  Gravity, however, is much weaker than electromagnetic forces.  Just as electric current moving back and forth in an antenna creates radio waves, objects moving around each other in orbits emit gravitational waves.  Because gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces, it takes truly massive objects to make gravitational waves we can detect.  Everybody expected gravitational waves to exist, the challenge was to make a receiver sensitive enough to detect them.  Basically no practical importance as far as human existence is concerned.  However, the detection of the gravitational waves is a brilliant feat of experimental physics.",

They hope he will get rid of Obamacare, which ironically, will hurt them the most. Under Obamacare, my pre-existing condition is insured. Before it, I struggled to make payments. Under the exchange, I pay just $200/month for health insurance. Also - My car insurance is down to $25/month (from Insurance Panda). My renters insurance is just $10/month. Under Trump, America will become too unaffordable to live in. \n\nTrump is either a buffoon -- not good -- or in service of the Russians -- same.

Sam's wife was by his side through chemo, surgeries, bone marrow transplants, and radiation.  They are the strongest young couple I've ever met. He rallied for a short time and was a part of President Obama' s security team on his trip to Africa. Sam was an EOD specialist. He was strong and proud, loved rugby and tattoos, and he was a loyal friend, son, husband and big brother. Being out on the river was a favorite place - we brought him there to say goodbye.

This policy could INCREASE harm by causing smokers to inhale more smoke in order to get the nicotine they want. It is basically a crank idea with no real-world backing, being promoted by ostensible experts who ought to know better. Very worrying.\n\nAs for Mr. Cunningham's (of the Canadian Cancer Society) comments — what's the point in being a \"world leader\" in deploying risky, unproven health policy with the potential to create vast, negative unintended consequences?

But on this issue, where are Christ's words unclear, or made less clear by \"His whole ministry\"?  You argue that, when taken in toto, Jesus' commandment is merely to love.  Well, He certainly told us not to commit adultery, and loving one's spouse includes not committing adultery.  You would argue that one does not commit adultery by divorcing and re-marrying.  Jesus clearly said the opposite.  Is there a single false statement in this post, so far?  \n\nWhich leads to the next point:  Since Jesus himself --- God Himself --- spoke clearly on divorce, who are we to say he was wrong?  You would argue --- you would HAVE to argue --- that YOU have a right to say, in good conscience, that you are right and God is wrong.  But that would entail your denying God's very existence, because God cannot be wrong.\n\nWhere in all this do you disagree?",
