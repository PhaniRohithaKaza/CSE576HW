It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

The weapons charge was due to a hand gun that was still on the seat of his car after he had been target shooting, that had inadvertently had a coat pushed onto it. The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

Additionally, of course, there are more couples living together unmarried than there are married and, not surprisingly, more children being born to unmarried couples than married couples.  Indeed, times have changed.  \n\nIt always amazes me that those who scream the loudest against abortions are frequently the same ones who scream just as loudly against contraception...Bill advocates for \"abstainance only\" birth control....perhaps he should ask Sarah Palin and daughter Bristol, two of the A.Os leading advocates, how successfully it works......Gary Crum",

Your quotation from John Jay (JJ) correctly asserts the exact opposite.

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy. IMHO, globally the correct figure today is minimally 50%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Reliable data is virtually impossible given the ongoing preference for the closet among priests.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years, according to a report released by his doctor.\nThe side effects of this drug are legion, and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire. The article is not, \"Nurses open body bag to examine strange growths on a patient's genitals\" or something along those lines. This is not a case of medical intrigue, what it is, is a case of nurses using their position to take advantage of a patient - dead or alive.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

Sometimes it doesn't. The intent should always be to give to the beloved through sexual expression. \n\nSex  is certainly not the only way to show love, nor is \"making love\" the only way to have sex, and I am not saying that all instances of \"having sex\" are inspired by love.  People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other. Then it is indeed \"making love.\"",

You can't just have it because it's fun or because it makes you feel closer to your spouse. \n\nBTW, that's the main argument for the perpetual virginity of Mary: Sex is sinful, so the sinless Mary didn't engage in it. \n\nSo, they said that \"natural law\" says that the proper reason for sex is procreation, and sex must be \"open\" to it.

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans.

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked. Since I was the youngest, he chose me to be punished first. He had me lay across his lap while he proceeded to spank my bare bottom.",

Sodomy is just self-gratification and homosexual sodomy is just imitative of real sex, and, therefore, of no social redeeming value.",

Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.\"  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.\n\nI've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was \"raped\" for their sexual encounters.

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point.

It's now a blood sport--and Kelly can't do much about that, either, because his employer simply lunges at the bait.  Twitter forever!\n\nNow, in explaining this, I'm not condoning this.  But it does help explain the rabid reaction of the media.  Including the language in this over-the-top editorial, and the persistent shock-and-disbelief demeanour of the woman anchoring CBC's National these evenings. \n\nTrump...he's irresistible!",

The government allowed the mining company to come in and create what was called the largest open pit mine in the world (at that time). The people were told the mine would be a source of employment even though most of the people then raised sheep, had herds of cattle and grew fields of corn, chile, beans, with large orchards of apples, apricots, peaches and grapes. It was a good life. About twenty plus years later they pulled out of the mine and left behind total destruction of areas where the fields were. Not only that, people were dying of cancer and children born with birth defects. By then many of the herds were gone and growing food from poisoned ground was not an option.\nWater is sacred.

Regarding SNAP, George W Bush added 14.7 million SNAP users during his 2 terms and Obama added 13.4 million. Regarding the stock market, during Obama's first 100 days the stock market rose 8.4% compared to Trumps 5.5%. When Obama took office the DJIA was 7,949 and when he left it was 19,887 and on one day, August 14, 2017, all three major stock market indexes set records. Under Obama the unemployment rate went from 10% when he took office to 4.8% when Trump took office. So maybe you should do some homework before you post nonsense.....",

The problem with this type of hockey: is that you don't take charge of your own destiny and anything can happen. For example, Kessel finally goes up the middle, gets a lucky bounce and he zips it in past Anderson.  I am not sure what Kessel and Malkin were going on about? but Malkin played another confused game, where he simply looked lost and casually coasted along the boards, like a past Maple Leaf we are all aware of, then would dump the puck back to his own defencemen, rather than create anything critical to the outcome of the game.

Nevertheless, after WWII, accommodation became the norm.

I would like to see it outlawed, but I am not holding my breath.  I also believe many  would not have an abortion if it was considered illegal, instead of  the belief it is a legal accepted choice.

They were just young and arrogant as recent graduates often are. They were the kind of people John Wooden was talking about when he said, \"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.\" \n\nThey left the seminary knowing it all.

A fraction of managers will outperform their benchmarks over shorter time frames, say up to 5 years, but they always regress toward the mean eventually.

First though, there is a big distinction between intercity high-speed rail (HSR) and intrAcity grade-separated rail. Honolulu is not building HSR, they are building a grade-separated metro rail system. Think of it as a subway but elevated. The advantage of these systems over at-grade light rail are that 1) they travel faster between stations (up to 55mph) since there are no traffic lights, cars, bikes or peds to avoid, 2) they can have longer trains (at-grade trains are restricted by the minimum city block lengths), and 3) they can operate with shorter headways (more frequent).  These advantages add up to roughly double the average speed (30 vs 15mph) and around 4 times the maximum operating capacity (ppl/hr/direction).  HSR is a totally different beast. It goes over 200mph and stations are often hundreds of miles apart.",

People who throw insults at others from a position of assumed superior knowledge create a sort of oxymoron - if you actually had the knowledge you would not need to descend to the level of insulting others.",

If oil was the $60 per barrel as described as a hypothetical by the Governor, the gross value of the oil being removed from Alaska would be over $11 billion dollars per year.

But, IMHO, they are fighting the female diaconate tooth and nail, because they recognize the unity of the sacrament of orders--if  women in the past have in fact been deacons sacramentally equal to male deacons, then they can receive the sacrament, and that means as deacons, priests, and bishops. If women are ordained deacons, this logic will not be accepted immediately (they will argue deacons yes, but no further) but that logic is sound, and will eventually win the day. \n\nBTW, I think the ontological argument was put forward by Paul6, but dropped from  JP2's Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, tacitly acknowledging that it is bull. That leave only the argument that women have never been ordained because Jesus' selection of 12 male apostles is an implicit prohibition of women. That whole delusion collapses  if women were ever ordained.",

I believe they are, but I stand to be corrected.\n2) If an aboriginal community has not signed a land claim settlement, are its members are entitled to all of these benefits?

I confronted the police about allowing a handful of drunks to drive off into the sunset.

You are also making the assumption that all of these ballots out there all get sent in, when, if true, they likely ended up in the garbage.  I stand by my assertion that you basically accused my mother and/or her siblings of filling out my grandparents' ballots and voting illegally....and you have no proof.\n\n\"There are individuals who have passed away and moved, that are still on the voting roles.\"\n\nNo kidding.  I was one of them.  When I moved from Morgan County, CO to Nebraska, I didn't go to the courthouse to tell them I was moving.  When my maternal grandparents died, my mother and her siblings didn't go to the courthouse to unregister my grandparents from voting....and I bet you didn't/won't either.",

Paulette Kelekini, sued because the city didn't follow State law regarding the AIS for projects.  And the lawsuits by Cayetano, Work on rail was never stopped by a court order on any of the lawsuits brought on by Cayetano and company.  What about the delays caused by the city.  Issuing contracts in 2009  yet never got the ok to start construction by the FTA until 2012.  You need to stop blaming others and start putting blame where it belongs.  All delays were fault and caused by the city.  If the city had not rushed this project, and done everything by the book, none of this would have happened.",

So what the heck was that priest talking about who told the family that putting the child in a facility was tantamount to abandonment?  What Church teaching is that?  The priest acted beyond the scope of his ability.  \n\nHis reply should have been that the Church teaches, blah-blah; that we know this from Scripture blah-blah, and that as parents you should proceed knowing this.  Simple as that.  Telling the family it is ok/not ok to abandon the child is treating them like infants.  Telling a couple that the Church teaches X, but it's ok for you to act differently is also treating them like infants.",

That Ms Freeland's grandfather served on the editorial board of a newspaper published during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine does not make him a \"Nazi\" (no Ukrainian ever could be a member of the NSDAP, as Ukrainians were considered to be untermenschen, i.e. subhumans) or even pro-Nazi. In fact there is some evidence to suggest the editors used their positions to help the Ukrainian nationalist resistance to the Nazi occupation (and later against the Soviet re-occupation of western Ukraine).

Whether they would have been successful in that pursuit if they had had standing is altogether another matter. My point in responding is to acknowledge that yes, Tununuk was far more than that sole point alone.

The Democratic Party here needs a correction, having bought into supply side economics for a long time. And for the good of our community here that needs to happen. Instead we are actually discussing birds, seriously. Ms Kent can form her own Guillermo theater group and emote all she wants. That's the Green Party. It's just not the Dem Party, Bernie supporters need a reboot. And that involves seriously thinking how to advance their ideas. This is dead end.",

That's money taken out of the economy, given to state workers who manage programs that further restrict the economic potential of the state.\n\nWe are shooting ourselves in the head with an income tax. And the polls say on 16% of us want a tax.",

I believe if we truly go to Jesus, then (this is important) put our trust in His Word, that with Him all things are possible (not with man alone, but in cooperation with God's mercy and grace). Joe and his wife can make this act of love to God if they choose to. I said earlier, the choice is theirs - God does not force anyone to change, to live in a state of grace rather than sin but He wants more than anything that out of love for Him, we want to do this! Kevin, I am not sure what you mean by Joe publicly confessing his sin of impurity (with his second wife). Does he go up to the altar and say that out loud that he is living in sin? I have never seen this done. If he were to do this, I have no doubt that the Priest would certainly seek him out in private after Mass. (Continued)",

BC Hydro's residential, commercial and industrial customers used less electricity in 2016 than in 2005, according to the utility's own records. BC can create yet more reductions in electricity consumption easily by investing in more efficient motors and lighting. In addition, solar power can be generated on utility scale at far less than what Site C will cost. Alberta created power capacity at Shepard Energy Centre at $1.75 million per MW. Site C will cost $8-10 million per MW. That means we won't be selling expensive power to our neighbours. Nor will we sell surpluses to California where they are closing power stations because conservation is happening through modern technologies.  If the only reason to build Site C is to create jobs, we'll create more jobs by building it with picks, shovels and hand labour. That would employ more people.",

In this sense, he appears to be sending a signal that he wants CDF to be more pastoral and that, if necessary, he will replace Mueller.\nSome commentators in Rome believe O'Malley is Francis' choice to succeed him, in which case a position in CDF would help make his case in a future conclave.",

One carried Alberta natural gas (north of Lake Superior) and the other (Enbridge, south of Lake Superior) carries crude oil. All of Canada west of the Ottawa river which includes Ontario were obligated to use Alberta petroleum.\n\nThe Arab oil cartel artificially inflated the price of crude in the mid 70s, eventually to $30 from $3, and a world recession ensued. The substitute for the NOP, the new NEP, was intended to partially shield Canadians from the artificially inflated Arab cartel price.  Alberta felt it was it's right to have the cartel equivalent from Canadians, and so today Ontario buys oil on the world market (St Lawrence Seaway).",

I grew up here in Eugene and always thought I'd end up in one of the ROTC programs but the Air Force program didn't last here which was a real shame.  We do not want all of our military officers trained at the academies if we want to retain civilian control over the military.

Each line that is changed is included in the back of the bill, and unless one is pretty familiar with the process or the media or a particular group calls out a specific change, most people will not know that it's there.  That's why I say it would be less transparent than just a single bill like 42.\n\nBill 42 currently has a lot of attention on it.
