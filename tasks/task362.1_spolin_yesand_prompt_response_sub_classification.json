    "Definition": "You are given a prompt with a tag ‘Prompt’ and two responses with tags ‘Response 1’ and ‘Response 2’ respectively. Your task is to identify which one of the two responses follows the \"yes-and\" principle and return its tag as answer. The \"yes-and\" principle suggests that a participant in the dialogue should implicitly or explicitly agree with what another participant said (\"yes\") and then extend the thought or context with additional information (\"and\").",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Prompt: You're just going to let us float down the river to our deaths? You said we were leaving Baltimore to find something! \n Response 1: We left Baltimore to find something new. Maybe that new thing is death. Do you want to give it a try with me? \n Response 2: Those are all bad places to be shot.",
            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "The prompt talks about leaving Baltimore to find something and the prospect of their deaths. Response 1 agrees with the prompt on both contexts and extends the thought. So, Response 1 is the rightly choosen as the answer."

            "input": "Prompt: See, Arlene? That's why I don't talk to you like that because I'm afraid I'll scare our son. \n Response 1: I have 12. Wait, is the key to a success story getting the number to go down? \n Response 2: Oh, Dad. Even that wasn't great.",
            "output": "Response 2",
            "explanation": "In the prompt, a person's talks about his way of talking with respect to his son. And Response 2 gives the response of the person's son which means it continues the conversation in the same context. So, answer is Response 2."

            "output": "Response 2",
            "explanation": "The prompt talks about the dog's alleged death and its unexpected moving. Response 1 accepts the prompt and extends it by giving a reason for th edog's movement. So, answer should be Response 1."

            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "Response 2 is in context with the prompt which is about names, agrees implicitly with it and extends the conversation. So, answer should be Response 2."
