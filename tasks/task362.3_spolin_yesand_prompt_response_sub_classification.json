    "Definition": "Specify your answer with \"Response 1\" if the first answer is correct, otherwise with \"Response 2.\" \"Yes, and\" is a rule of thumb in improvisational comedy that requires a participant in a dialogue to accept what another participant has said (\"yes\"), and then expand that mindset or context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"yes, and...\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information in addition to the information / settings constructed by another speaker. Note that a \"yes, and\" does not require someone to explicitly say \"yes, and...\" during a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if he agrees with the above description. There are many ways to respond to this.",
