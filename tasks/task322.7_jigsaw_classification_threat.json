I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

Obviously those people have zero experience with the preconcillar tradition. Hence, I don't see how a heavy-handed imposition of the liturgical reform would spur them to do this, as they have no recollection of such imposition.\n\nMy inclination is that the younger generation finds comfort in old tradition because they lack the bravery to confront (or are uncomfortable confronting) new challenges.

Just observe who are our doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, teachers (yes, teachers).  Now, not to say that people doing service industry or other lower paying jobs do NOT value education, but some jobs simply require a lot more higher education and thus, require people who would value it and strive for it.  It is also a spiraling circle, too, because those who do value education and get the high paying jobs can also more easily afford to send their children to college.

Fund balances are not the result of simply asking for money than expected need.  Financial plans require expenditures to equal revenues, so in essence, a spending cap already exists with the current tax cap.\n\nA new, unnecessary spending cap encourages short term waste of fund balances as government pumps up budgeted spending levels, using fund balances as a revenue source to enhance the level of future spending cap calculations.

His defence being that he did nothing wrong grazing on \"his\" land and was only protecting his cattle from an illegal government seizure on lands they have no authority over... In addition to his constitutional arguments he also claims that mormons have prior ownership before  the US government secured this part of the west under a treaty with Mexico.. Lets hope that state ownership of all federal land is not the future..",

I got over that one when I was seven years old.\n\n I can't speak for all liberals, but this is not how I absorb and integrate information.  My personal experience has been that on too many occasions given authorities are dead wrong and that includes bishops and priests and all the rest of the ontologically superior caste of Catholic authority.  All one need do is spend some quality alone time reading a decent history of the Church to discern how often the authorities have been invoking non-authoritative personal opinion as authoritative teaching.  I proceed by the mantra 'buyer beware' and that includes the Roman Catholic teaching magisterium.",

Besides raises, tax cuts for the middle class which accounts for 70% of consumer spending are another way to gain immediate growth and stimulate production of more goods. Corporations are doing well and many are flush with cash already \nand adding more cash will take a huge tax cut down below 15% because corporations effectively pay at the 15% rate.

What Dodd-Frank has accomplished is the acceleration of the growth of the size of the banking industry. This growth has been fueled by the consolidation of banks into even bigger behemoths, & a substantial decrease in smaller, community banks who cannot afford to comply with the drastic regulatory costs. There is, in fact, a growing consensus among policy makers that Dodd-Frank has made Too Big To Fail worse, & therefore should be repealed. Neel Kashkari - currently pres of the Minneapolis Fed Reserve is arguing for repealing DF & capping the size of banks. He is a Republican.",

I also think the studies that define the five primary moral values are absolutely true, and their association with either liberal or conservative views is also correct.  If a person thinks about it in any depth, we can see these realities for ourselves.  Unfortunately, the view that religion is the source of all human evil that many today accept, like Richard Dawkins and his fans, is a mechanistic view of both religion and people, and not a valid understanding of either.      \n\nHowever, I think there is more to morality than the studies address.  Having a conscience, empathy, and a sense of responsibility are more than values - they are experienced, or not experienced, internally and emotionally, and in many cases have been shown by PET to be hardwired in the brain.",

And police made sure nothing got out of hand, & dispersed them when it looked like it might.  \n\nHad the anti-Nazi folks peacefully demonstrated, & police kept them apart as is normal, the violence wouldn't have happened.  Someone has to start & respond to violence for violence to take place, & the police have to stand down, which they only do when told to. Why were they told to? Might the mentally deranged man who drove his care into the crowd have done so if it stayed non-violent and the police dispersed both crowds? Possibly.  No one knows.

A variety of ancient myths point to an original state of harmony violated by human initiative. From this perspective, we may find it difficult to understand why peace is so elusive, when it should be so easy to return to our natural state.\nScience points to a perspective that may help us understand the human condition. The natural state of any object is actually one of dynamic tension and at least implicit conflict. We all know Newton's Third Law of  Motion (every action has an equal and opposite reaction) and understand that all of us are constantly exerting force against everything else, which means we're actually competing with one another. In this view, peace is the elusive goal, and conflict the abiding reality. That may be hard to accept, but it helps explain why things are as they are, and why peace doesn't come naturally.",

Pipeline companies charge tolls to ship oil or gas and those tolls are mandated by the national regulator. Doesn’t have anything to do with the price of oil (so much for your Econ 101 tutorial). Here’s some more basic economics and energy knowledge for you, when Eastern Canada imports oil via ship (tidewater) that oil is based off Brent pricing. Brent oil currently trades at a ~$7 premium to WTI. Canadian oil is landlocked due to lack of infrastructure thus trades off WTI. So we sell our oil at a discount to WTI which trades at a discount to Brent because we can’t figure out how to build a pipeline. And Eastern Canada gets screwed with higher gasoline prices because they have to import more expensive oil priced off Brent. Educate yourself on the facts vs taking G&M opionion pieces at face value.",

John Mbiti (1969) describes a concept of reality in traditional African thought as being rooted in the past and present, with very little weight being put on the 'non-real' space of the future. If we understand our students to be trapped in this inter-generational time-based reality, our task is to engage them educationally in ways that challenges this notion, by creating experiences wherein they see immediate benefits to science-based interventions within their own communities.

Hersh’s primary question regarding reporters and editors at major news outlets these days was: “Do they care what the facts are?\nMy experience was similar at The Associated Press. Among the older editors, there was still a pride in getting the facts right – and not getting misled by some politician or spun by some government flack.\nThat journalistic code, however, no longer exists – at least not on foreign policy and national security issues. The major newspapers and TV networks are staffed largely by careerists who uncritically accept what they are fed by U.S. government officials or what they get from think-tank experts who are essentially in the pay of special interests.\"\nhttps://consortiumnews.com/2016/04/07/a-media-unmoored-from-facts/",

For us relative newcomers to Portland, there's been Rich's and the series of locations of Ron and Teresa Somerlott's downtown news and magazine shops under different names.   Those latter shops seem to fit the description of the Simmons store.   There's was another classic downtown newsstand at two locations: 2nd and SW Alder then moved to NW Broadway and Burnside.

A booming real estate market had developers again interested in longer-term projects, maybe to sell units to potential landlords looking for an income stream (e.g. retiring baby boomers).  Even talk of rent controls by the government (not just NDP) will slam the brakes on these developments. A rolling rent control scheme (controlled only after 25 years) may be fair and predictable, but will not solve the immediate problem.

And slavery.   \n\nIn brief, history shows us that the Church was a reluctant opponent of slavery; protestant abolitionists were the vanguard of the anti slavery movement, while the Church stood on the sidelines during the Civil War.   \n\nThe Church has only been pro-immigrant when it suited is aims.   During the 1800s, the Church was all for the immigration of European Catholics to America.   The reason why is the same reason for why the Church today is pro immigration from Latino countries.   In a word, power.   \n\nLarge scale immigration in the 1800s led to Catholicism going from a very marginal and hated religion, to the U.S.'s largest and most powerful religion.   \n\nThe bishops know the awesome political power of immigration.",

All of these moves improve the offensive line greatly.  And I think the Panthers are on a downward spiral anyway.  Their Super Bowl appearance was an aberration.  True, they didn't have Luke Kuechly for much of last year, but Cam Newton practically willed them to their Super Bowl 50 appearance against the Broncos.

Now imagine that you diversely invested that $1M instead - including in real estate holdings, if you were so-inclined.

I understand being positive, yet Joseph \"liked\" an offensive team that hat had not scored a TD in the last three quarters of their last game and \"liked\" not scoring a TD in the first half. Well the Broncos lived up to the expectations Joseph gave them and Joseph got More what he \"liked\" and the Broncos were embarrassed at home. Both the offense and the defense played like this was a tune up game for games down the toad. When the coach is not focused and satisfied, the team will have a let down every time!",

I've long believed that what happens at the Mass is a lot less about what the priest does, as it is what WE do.  It may be hard to describe, but perhaps one facet of this is that we learn to see each other, not for where we are different, but for how we are alike.  We may be at many different levels in our faith development, but there is a commonality in that time next to each other: a sharing of what we are perhaps, or an acceptance of how we are part of something bigger, or maybe a chance to reach out to another.  The mass can be a lot of things, but a good place to start is to recognize what draws us together.",

But it's also important to make explicit what Unthank Tower implies. For \"culture\" is not only music, books and our heritage. It is those patterns of meaning any group or society uses to interpret and evaluate itself and its situation. It is the symbolic and learned aspects of society transmitted not biologically but via social interaction. Nor can culture be reduced to, or explained away by, economic and political factor, though of course those factors certainly do influence -- without determining -- culture for good and ill, as Unthank Tower and the plight of rock 'n' roll and cinema demonstrate vividly.",

Now, all of a sudden, the focus is on the Russians. Ironically, some people who now claim to want transparency about the computer hacking, are also unhappy that e-mails from the DNC were made available to the public, showing such things as the cooperation between the Clinton campaign and the DNC against Sanders, for instance. To my knowledge, the accuracy of these e-mails was never disputed, so some Clinton supporters are presumably mad that voters learned the truth before voting.
