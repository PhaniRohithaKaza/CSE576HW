    ],
    "Definition": "In this task the input has a statement, a genre, and a label. You have to write a sentence that follows the tone with respect to the statement, as indicated by the label. If the label says entailment the generated sentence must agree with the given statement, if it says contradiction it has to disagree with the statement, if it says neutral the sentence should be neither agree nor disagree with the statement. The generated sentence must also belong to the genre specified.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Statement: Next to the MGM Grand you will find M and M World. Label: neutral. Genre: travel.",
            "output": "The candy has many fans who love its attractions.",
            "explanation": "The places are specifically pointed out and referred to as attractions and hence are in the same genre. We don't know if the candy has many fans, hence the sentence is neutral."
        },
        {
            "input": "Statement: I've forgotten his name now, confessed Tuppence. Label: neutral. Genre: fiction.",
            "output": "Tuppence remembered his name later.",
            "explanation": "Both sentences describe the actions of a character and hence are in the genre fiction. Tuppence may or may not remember the name later, hence the sentence is neutral."
        },
        {
            "input": "Statement: One of the first organizational realignments taking place is in the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. Label: entailment. Genre: government.",
            "output": "The office of the taxpayer advocate is having an organizational realignment.",
            "explanation": "Both sentences refer to the reorganization of an official department, hence the genre is government and the label is entailment."

            "input": "Statement: yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range. Label: contradiction. Genre: telephone.",
            "output": "The tennis shoes are not over hundred dollars.",
            "explanation": "The sentences seem to be part of a dialogue, hence the genre is telephone. The shoes are definitely over a hundred dollars and hence the label is contradiction."

            "explanation": "The sentences sound like they are part of a government survey report, hence the genre is government. However, it is not known if 0.25 of all households was considered a large number at the time, hence the label is neutral. So the generated answer is incorrect."

            "explanation": "It is not clear how many people were seen by Dr. Famous, hence the genre is neutral. However, the statistics given in the sentence sound like they belong in a government survey and hence the genre is not fiction."
