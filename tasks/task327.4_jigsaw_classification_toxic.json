On those grounds, I agree.\n\nAfter all, we now are faced with much on-line commentary that suggests neo-liberal globalism is the product of the \"left\". When young leftists were drawing the WTO agenda to a halt in Seattle 1999, they were being called out as fringe and communists by those on the \"right\". So many of those who cheered regional trade agreements and investor dispute mechanisms have changed their minds........and now suggest it was the \"left\". \n\nYet, I do believe Doug Saunders might want to clear the air with a column in which he makes it clear not all those questioning neo-liberal globalism are anti-Semitic etc - unless he wants to create the false image.",

In regards to the American Revolution Movement, John Adams and Sam Adams stood on the principles, but it wasn't until he was financially affected that Hamilton came in. He grabbed for power because they equate money and power. The second segment resorts to playing power games. Nikki Haley and those who see her as being a great ambassador do so because they are standing on the power games, not the principles. There is no judgment.

There is no relationship between a safety slap on the hand and reduced developmental abilities of a child.

It owes far more in the way of ideas and outlook to Buddhism. Sikhs believe that a god created the universe, and left some important lessons about how to live in the form of holy books. However, there are no miracles, there is no hell, no devil, and no messiah. A Sikh is expected to live as a \"soldier\" who defends the innocent; a \"scholar\" who trains his mind in the holy book AND in the laws that govern the material universe; and a \"saint,\" one who lives a moral and ethical life.\n\nThose who fall short of those goals are reincarnated to try again.

Why?  Because \"marriage,\" by definition, meant one man, one woman (although in some instances, polygamy), but never man-man or woman-woman.    Note, by the way, that the Declaration, Article 10, says \"without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion.\"  It does not forbid a prohibition on grounds of sex, meaning man marrying man or woman marrying woman.  Indeed, such a prohibition would have been though absurd when the Declaration was passed in 1948, because the very idea of such \"marriage\" was absurd.",

They need experienced full-time staff for the majority of the program delivery and continuity to ensure quality.\n\nThe reality is that instead these colleges have loaded up management administrators at the expense of front-line teaching staff.  The number of these managers has DOUBLED over the past 16 years while the number of faculty members has decreased relative to the number of students in the same period.  I estimate that the college system could save $200 million annually just by going back to the 2001 ratio of management to students.\n\nWhat other organizations have doubled their management staff ratio?  It's ridiculous.",

They then get released and are ordered to register as a sex offender. So now its the community's responsibility to keep our children safe?, to check the sex offender register to see how many are in our area. Now we are responsible for making sure our children are not abused sexually? NO! this is the responsibility of the system to make sure our children have a chance in life. A pedophile can not and will not stop abusing. By releasing these people, its an endangerment to the community, they will never stop abusing because they are mentally unable. When this judge sentences this man for attacking these pedophiles, I hope he knows that this man never had a chance at life to be who he could be.",

One reality in public procurement is that contractors know that the public is the final payor, so delays and cost overruns are very common and very large (see defense spending!!).  Injecting a profit motive, therefore, CAN in principle force efficiency, as a build/operate firm has real incentives to control costs.  Against that there is the fact they expect to make a decent return, much more than the % cost of debt to the government.

My own opinion is they use the term \"opioids\" purposely to obscure the fact it's heroin...the term opioid is more of a catch all word that keeps the reader from making a firm determination as to what's causing the overdoses.  It's that type of vague, gray terminology that addict apologists use to muddy the waters and keep folks off balance.

Many people of all religions and beliefs could care less what moral values or choices that others choose to follow, but many also have deeply held beliefs that they should not personally be involved. As in your examples LGBT laws will give LGBT a superiority over other classes. That is why it all must be reconciled so that photographers, bakers, counselors, etc are not forced by the government to labor for or serve any class that they have deeply held opinions and religious views against.  This is probably Minnery's opinion.",

He said that many laws limiting those rights are still valid and enforceable, such as: guns in the hands of mentally ill, guns in sensitive places like schools and government buildings, regulations on the sale of arms, and other necessary laws that may restrict the right to carry weapons. He wrote the majority opinion in the Heller case.\n\nAlso, in my opinion it is the gun and ammunition industry that is behind the drive against any and all efforts to bring down the level of gun violence, as it affects their bottom line--money.

As our scientific understanding of humanity deepens through science, I believe we have to accept that past understandings do not represent the \"Will of God\" as much as the understanding (or misunderstanding) of humans.

There's pregame activities and post-game activities as well. PUBLIC activities, that are part of the event that the employees are there putting on for the public. One of the pieces of the whole event is a performance of the national anthem, on the field, usually on TV, where the cameras put the players, coaches, staff, etc on display standing and showing respect for the national anthem.\n\nYou could complain about not liking that the national anthem is part of the pregame, but the fact is that IT IS.

That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Each major field of study within economics would do well to find its own Heinleinian acronym so as to keep policy prescription anchored to the basics. Let me propose a suitable one for the field of public finance: TANSTAABST. There ain’t no such thing as a big simple tax. Head taxes, the only truly simple taxes, are never big; income taxes, the primary source of revenue for the welfare state, are never simple. The claim, made repeatedly by supply-siders, that with a flat tax our tax form would be the size of a postcard can easily be exposed as bad science fiction.\n\nThe character limitation does not allow me to quote more from this, but the author does explain just why a flat tax would not, in fact, be simple.",

This is not a long-term problem if they intend to live, work and get taxed here, but it causes more competition so incumbents hate it.

I have asked you several times about how Aurora's growth has decimated the rural populations and about investing and improving the rural areas so they can contribute more but your only answer is that rural areas get more money than urban. 15 acres may not be a lot but where do we stop? If it is beneficial to Aurora to turn all of Eastern Colorado into one huge dam is that also 'worth it'? You only want to discuss how great it will be for everybody if Aurora condemns land 100 miles away. There are more issues at stake here than just more state tax money for the rural areas.

Being consistently reminded that without a law degree that your opinion is less valuable than uncollected dog droppings even if it is within your area of expertise and outside theirs. So yes, pity the lawyers.",

At that time reports on the evening news were almost daily. Was he upset at the Priests who molested the children? No! He ranted and raved about the news media and Press being responsible for the whole scandal! At no point did Teresa Tomeo point out to him that it was Priests that had molested children and they were responsible, not the Press. She just egged him on and blessed him and told him what a great Catholic he was! I couldn't believe what I heard! Where was all that Catholic teaching about taking responsibility for your actions and confessing your sins. One of my cousins is a Priest. He warned me not to listen to EWTN!

The Canadian PM appoints the cabinet; the PM controls the appointments of senior Deputy Ministers; and the PM can appoint all of the members of the Supreme Court and of the Superior courts in each province (not just half of them, as in Turkey).  And the PM can declare states of emergencies (e.g., 1970 October Crisis) and sets policies. In Turkey, the leader will be limited to two five-year terms whereas in Canada, a PM can serve longer.  So unless I hear of more specific powers granted by these amendments, I will keep an open mind.",

Observant Muslim women are not in general expected to wear the niqab.\n\nThe second issue is the rationale for the legislation in Quebec and many European countries. It has little to do with security and nothing to do with discrimination.  It is simply a fact that, in our culture, and most others, human interchange can only proceed successfully on a face to face basis.  This applies to business, education, and many services. It doesn't apply to riding on a bus or walking around on the street. The law should be amended, but its basis is sound.",

The Khadr case raised several important issues, including the extent to which national security can be held to justify Charter infringements as well as whether the actions of a claimant can be held to mitigate damages relating to Charter violations. Now we'll never know, at least unless or until another such case emerges. So, we paid Khadr's settlement money as well as the legal costs already incurred to establish essentially nothing.

That would have been about 6 percent of the entire US population and even higher percentages in the areas the second klan prospered like the midwest and west.

During his tenure he moved all kinds of general government debt onto the \"standard debt\" books.  In 2003/04, under McGuinty, the \"residual stranded debt\" jumped from $7.7B up to $11.5B.  Why?  No one really knows.  The Auditor General of Ontario looked into this a little while back and basically called the government out on being dishonest, but nothing much came from it.

The relatively low income of many state residents may have made it difficult for them to access basic necessities. Relatively few Alabama residents said they had enough money to afford medicine, food or adequate shelter. Alabama residents also had among the worst physical health in the nation. High blood pressure and diabetes in particular were much more common in Alabama than in most other states.

First off, who is an objective enough judge to determine what is or is not an \"informed\" vote?  Secondly, the democratic system we rely on functions best when everyone participates not just the 20% or so that turns out for the local/primary elections.  Next, a good portion of those are merely voting based upon party rather than information.  By your suggestion we'd see maybe 2-5% of voters turning out.  Also, uninformed voters, statically speaking, should be a wash so they aren't likely to be a deciding factor anyway.  Finally, I just simply have to disagree with you a more fundamental level.  Any vote is a good vote so long as it is cast in good faith.  While it is preferable to cast an informed vote the fact that one's information is limited or the voter is apathetic in most political matters doesn't make his/her participation any less valued or any more unwanted.",

Are you suggesting that corporation have no tax what-so ever?\n\nAnd yes profits are taxed on individule investment as income (dividends), or share price increase.

For low income Oregonians it allowed me to quickly see a doctor just two blocks away, with no deductible, and it also included basic dental and vision. It was simple and I suspect was fairly inexpensive. It's implementation was efficient and flexible. \nIf given the choice between that Oregon Health Plan and the VA system, or medicare, I would choose that Oregon Health Plan. Most vets don't get dental care. While there is a limited dental plan for veterans, it is quite limited.\nEven if national health care is expensive, it is probably the most important thing our govenment can do, get decent medical care to all Americans. I do worry about the future of the Affordable Care Act, and by the way, it is not permitted for veterans to enroll in both the VA and that system.\nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

It's understandable how he would mistake his son for an intruder. It's sad that he's dead but the world is a safer place because of Leo's actions.",

The answer would be what is in fact, an agreement with reality.  Thanks for informing me of your curiosity, but that is not my issue.  My issue is 'never' whether information is old or new, but whether it is true, conforms with what we know...if it does not, change and adapt to what is known.  Science is NOT God, that is a slur.  Science is our only objective method to find out and know factually.  If wrong, admits its mistakes, as Sagan said;  Religion and Politics never do.  The question begged still;  in regards to God, and never correctly answered...why does an all loving god create pain and suffering in his world.

It is a trend in an attempt to find a more wholesome form of celebration than club, rave, or drug-prominent festival dancing. It's also fueled by disillusionment with the whole festival scene. So EDM DJ's have started re-fashioning their sets to sound more like ecstatic dance. Actual ecstatic/conscious/free form dance is barefoot, substance free (no alcohol served) and practiced in regular weekly events and workshops. \nWe've had very little crossover with the Bliss jungle folk in the 15 years of my ecstatic dancing.

Amid the recent flurry of agency news releases about big game poaching comes the stark reality: This is nothing new.\"\n\n\"Since 2012, state police have averaged 764 poaching investigations a year, most involving elk or deer.\"\n\nThe illegal killings are a source of pure disdain for the vast majority of hunters, who willingly follow a litany of state regulations and vie for tags Duane Dungannon, state coordinator for the Oregon Hunters Association'.",

Thank God, our work was rewarded by complete success. After the order grew to large numbers, we found it was necessary to have someone of large experience to command. We chose General N. B. Forrest, who had joined our number. He was made a member and took the oath in the Room No. 10 of the Maxwell House at Nashville, Tennessee, in the fall of 1866, nearly a year after we organized at Pulaski. The oath was administered to him by Captain John W. Morton, afterwards Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee.[9]\"\n\nIn this case the term carpetbagger means war profiteer. So I can see why the KKK and south were against them, but to make it seem like the KKK was anti-carpetbagger and not racist is just dumb.",

That's a bit laughable.  Also, Mr. Ruedrich based his assertion of the number of voters who would have selected the Republican ballot in part on the hotly contested 2010 Republican primary, where there was a close race for U.S. Senate, which likely drew people to vote the Republican ballot.  Such was not the case in 2016, however.  I find Ruedrich's claims flawed and specious.",

If the women go to work but their husbands lose their jobs it might help gender pay equity but it will do nothing for either family finances or government finances.\n\nIt is a pretty big assumption to think that having 150,000 people joining the labour pool will result in 150,000 more full-time, good-paying jobs and therefore boost economic growth.  The study also predicts significant 'knock-on' effects from those 150,000 jobs as they are estimating $8B in new tax revenue from those jobs, or $53,333 per job.  Obviously most of these women entering the workforce will not be paying $50,000+ in income taxes, so a lot of that extra revenue is from other sources.",

Yes, this editorial is partly good, the part about stereotyping etc.  But it was still the same old libber condemnation of Trump himself that has led me to stereotype liberals as intolerant, self-centered individuals.  The quotes recounted above are not from, imho, good people.  The trouble is that those libbers believe they are good people, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The quotes recounted reveal people with zero tolerance for anything but their worldview.  They reveal people who regard their judgment and interpretation as absolute with no apparent recognition that they may be mistaken or that other viewpoints may have equal or greater validity.  This is what has pushed me to contempt of the \"libber\" worldview.  All the usual libber chants such as care for all races, the poor, the sick, the disadvantaged, etc. concern me greatly, yet I do not view Trump as the libbers do.

The second reason is that it followed SecState precedent set by Rice and Powell, the latter of whom actually wrote to HRC recommending she use a private server (though Powell later denied this, the email exists). Powell also refused to hand over emails to a committee, and destroyed emails (that probably were personal business).

Indeed, Sinn Fein has just called for a separation referendum.\n\nIt seems to me that if Britons want out of the EU, they should have a government fully committed to that idea. So PM May ought to call a general election and run on staying in the EU-- with conditions. She'll win. And if Britons really, really want out, they'll vote Labour.

The average sexual recidivism rate found was 13.7 percent and the average overall recidivism rate was 36.9 percent, based on an average follow-up period of 5 to 6 years.\n[Chapter 5: Adult Sex Offender Recidivism | Sex Offender Management ...\nhttps://www.smart.gov/SOMAPI/sec1/ch5_recidivism.html].\nThis article goes contrary to everything I studied through the Massachusets Institute of Forensic Pathology which taught numbers totally inconsistent with those presented in this article.",

Compared to an employee, doctors with staff have a significant extra burden. The time it takes to run the business( that you don't get paid for)  is also significant, that employees don't face.

Starting with economic prosperity and equality: The USSR fell far behind the neighbouring European capitalist liberal democracies in productivity and wealth per capita. These neighbours also reduced economic inequality, making their poor much wealthier then the Russian poor. On top of that come the high costs of the communist system: lack of freedom, poor acces to basic human rights, state violence, ecological devastation, militaristic agression and incidents of intentional famine or other forms of mass murder. And the democracy only existed when rigorously following state doctrine under the watchfull eye of the secret police. \nThe main lessons from 2017 and what followed are on what NOT to do. Liberal democracies with good governance and functioning civil society have more to teach.",

The study also found that contact with Insite’s addictions counsellor significantly increased a person’s chances of enrolling in detox. \nContrary to fears that Insite might be deterring drug users from seeking treatment, these findings strongly suggest that Insite is facilitating entry into detoxification services among its clients.",
