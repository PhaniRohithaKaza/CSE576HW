    "Definition": "Considering prompt and two answers, identify which answer is the type of \"yes, and...\" If the first answer is correct, indicate your answer through \"response 1\" otherwise \"response 2\". \"yes, and\" in an improvisational comedy has a polar rule that suggests that a participant in a conversation should accept what the other participants said (\"yes\") and then extend to the line of the idea or reference (\"and...\").",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Prompt: You're just going to let us float down the river to our deaths? You said we were leaving Baltimore to find something! \n Response 1: We left Baltimore to find something new. Maybe that new thing is death. Do you want to give it a try with me? \n Response 2: Those are all bad places to be shot.",
            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "The prompt talks about leaving Baltimore to find something and the prospect of their deaths. Response 1 agrees with the prompt on both contexts and extends the thought. So, Response 1 is the rightly choosen as the answer."

            "output": "Response 2",
            "explanation": "In the prompt, a person's talks about his way of talking with respect to his son. And Response 2 gives the response of the person's son which means it continues the conversation in the same context. So, answer is Response 2."

            "output": "Response 2",
            "explanation": "The prompt talks about the dog's alleged death and its unexpected moving. Response 1 accepts the prompt and extends it by giving a reason for th edog's movement. So, answer should be Response 1."

            "output": "Response 1",
            "explanation": "Response 2 is in context with the prompt which is about names, agrees implicitly with it and extends the conversation. So, answer should be Response 2."
