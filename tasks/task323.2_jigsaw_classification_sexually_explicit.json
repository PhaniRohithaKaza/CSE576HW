The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

A photo shows a hand behind her it does not show it on her ass and it certainly doesn't show it on her bare ass... In fact it shows the opposite as the skirt would most definitely look different than it does if the back of it were being lifted AND he would have to be a freaking contortionist to touch a bare ass from that 'position' of his arm without lifting the skirt.  So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

There is nothing like it in the World. \n\nSince the government is concerned about paying services to Alaskans, taking half of the dividend now will likely lead to poorer Alaskans requiring more services from the government.  The PFD's spent by poorer people flow immediately into the local economy for goods and services also.  That contraction will be hard felt by the smallest businesses. \n\nSolutions must be found in the gifts to Big Oil.

As far as definitions go, society as a whole must through elected representatives define what various actions and scenarios violate law and what consequence to apply.  As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

I know that the Four Square denomination was founded by Aimee Semple McPherson and still has a significant, but rapidly falling, number. \n\nPart of the problem with assessing this, is that many Pentecostal churches nowadays have a \"husband and wife\" pastor as their formal leaders. Both are known as pastors, but in practice it's rare that the wife pastor will teach the full congregation. In my opinion, the key to finding a real woman in charge is if she's listed as the senior pastor. In Pentecostal churches, that's almost always where the power resides.\n\nYou might be interested in this article, Nora.

Now--he was married twice, with both wives preceding him in death; his wishes were to have half of his ashes buried next to his first wife and the remaining half placed in the niche with his second wife; sounds easy, doesn't it? Well...not at the Catholic cemetery...can't split the ashes, church doesn't allow it.  I felt at least his family was following his wishes and they were not just casting their father's ashes aside.  Suffice it to say...I think some ashes ended up in the flowers of his first wife's grave...",

Eventually something will happen (large volcanic eruption or a meteor strike perhaps) that will increase the planetary albedo causing cooling of the atmosphere and resulting in the extra moisture precipitating out. If the temperature and atmospheric moisture aberrations to the high side go too far, then perhaps we trigger an ice age ourselves when we eventually figure out how to deplete the CO2 etc once we've moved to renewables. Taking that sort of view though is difficult when you're worried about maximizing quarterly profits or paying a monthly hydro bill but it would be nice if people capable of projecting aims etc far into the future were not simply ridiculed because they point out that 1 + 1 = 2 over century and millennial scales- The science is pretty much like simple arithmetic when you get above the noise and chatter- sorry about that but get over it.",

Just as that young boy's dream never escaped the sandlot, our Mencken worshipper's limits are circumscribed by carefully cataloged op-ed filler masquerading as reason and pith.\n\nA side note: Check out \"Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.L. Mencken, Individualist [1910],\" available online, and pages 116-117 for Mencken's views on the American negro [his words] and European immigrants. It makes Trump's stump rhetoric sound like Gandhi.",

If that's the point you're trying to make, him taking her into the men's room and a transgendered person using the women's restroom are two totally different scenarios. A male who identifies as female isn't going to have his penis on display in the female bathroom, because the stalls are all behind closed doors, so only a pervert who's peeking under or over stalls is going to know that the female in the next stall was actually born a male. If it's not, an unintended consequence of the ordinance would be that it would be difficult for him to take her out alone because it will prohibit her from entering the men's room because she doesn't identify as male.",

Even women's groups supported Bill over their female victim sisters.  And now you come forward saying you support the very woman who attacked all these victims. Then there's the case of Hillary laughing after getting a man a light sentence for what he did to a 12 year old girl .  Again---who's side are you on ?

The weapon used in the Las Vegas mass shooting was a semi-automatic firearm to which a bump stock was added so as to obtain an increased rate of fire. Therefore Mr. Whelan is correct when he writes, \"...it sounded like automatic fire.\" The firearm was semi-automatic.\nThis matters because some people, specifically those who know little about, and fear firearms, can easily be persuaded to join the gun control/confiscation camp with terms such as \"automatic fire\", \"fully automatic rifle\", \"machine gun\", \"assault weapon\", etc.\nTechnically, a fully automatic rifle continues to fire as long as the trigger is held back and there is ammunition in its clip. Bump stocks (and other add-on devices) require a bit of trigger finger dexterity so as to use the recoil-recovery-trigger reset-trigger press cycle to achieve an increased rate of fire with a SEMIAUTOMATIC firearm.",

(I find it curious that the man who was supposed to be  the great  theological expert writes a letter so devoid of theology and so concentrated on \"the manner.\" I believe that the anti-Amoris Laetitia crowd are slowly realizing that they do not really have a good theological argument and are proceding to simply to repeat themselves, to listen to their own echoes, and to insist on postulates which are slowly being discredited, while complaining about things not going their way.)

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

Of course, some of his spontaneous utterances such as when he attacks retail merchandising policy, can't become part of the political narrative no matter how hard the Conways, Spicers, and Bannons try.

Better means something different for a basketball player (more excellent in his craft) than say a burger (more pleasing in taste). We have to clarify the being of what is talked about. In this case, if in our metaphysics we understand that vocation is an object, then Christ's statement of \"better\" would refer to objective excellence. However, this is not the case. Vocation is rather a project of existential possibility. It is a part of one's personal being-with-God. With this metaphysics, the logical statement takes on a different meaning because the terms are now referring to a different being. Thus, Christ's statement means Mary's vocation is the best expression of serving God for her. Her vocation is hers. It is part of her personal relationship with God. No one can take that from her and say \"well she should be doing this instead.\"",

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

Also, the databases with which our NICS and state police operate are woefully inadequate.\nBy what means would you enforce any law that require that guns not in actual use or being maintained, be locked up? Child access prevention laws might prevent some incidents but it's essentially reactive; enforced only after a mishap, unless there is a provision for periodic inspections of compliance. That might be a Fourth Amendment infraction.\nI know enough about gun control progressives to know they'd gut the Second Amendment. Just look at some of the posts here.

The one talking to the digital analysis and digital targeting of the campaign.  And, he's repeatedly been uncovered as one who lies on his SF86 and was physically in meetings with Russians even AFTER making panicked amendments to his SF86.\n\nBig.  HUGE dilemma for Trump.

But if, God forbid, my penis were cut off, there would be no less love in my marriage, nor would my marriage be in jeopardy.  I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.  My college-age daughter told me sex is a prerequisite to dating!",

The water vapor mixing ratio only changes with temperature, and is a feedback to CO₂ changes. And again, the consensus estimate for the contribution to the GHE from water vapor is ~50% (not 91%), and the contribution from CO₂ is ~20%. 20% of 33K is not \"3 C\".\n\nWater vapor is indeed the closest thing to a \"black body\" selective absorber, but it does so quite near the surface. The energy balance is determined by the energy flux differential at the effective emission height significantly higher in the troposphere where water vapor is scarce, and CO₂ remains well-mixed. In contrast to your odd assertion of \"not much energy\" at the absorption band of CO₂, a quick look at the Earth's Planck curve with GHG interaction tells a different story.\n\nhttps://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/rad4.gif",

This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.

The R20-billion claim would average to over R4-million per deregistered fund - presumably this would either be left in dormant accounts or would have been removed improperly, i.e. stolen.  But these were mainly small funds and their assets would typically have been no more than a few million Rands at best, in most cases - to suggest that R4 or 5 million per fund would simply have been \"left over\", unclaimed, once the in-service members and any pensioners had been transferred out, is simply not plausible.

They disagree on tariffs and immigration, but on most other substantive issues, they are pretty similar ... aside from the rhetoric they use.\n\nI'm not voting for any of the three of them. I suspect any of them will become a dictator in order to \"save the people from themselves.\" Sanders would enslave the well-off to the poor. Hillary has always made a lot of statements that show she's a totalitarian. Trump would circumvent the Constitution to do what is practical.\n\nI'm voting 3rd party this time around. This situation is caused by our adherence to the 2-party system, so some of the solution will be found in thinking outside of the box.",

Should or should there not be laws against bigamy, polygamy, bestiality, consensual incest? Should all marriages be \"open\" with each and every spouse engaging in sexual relations with multiple other sexual partners....who in turn engage in sex with multiple partners? Why even have \"marriage\" at all? \n-\nOr do we, as a society, try to establish some sort of \"limitation\" on what is good, proper, and healthier for all individuals, the marriage institution, the family, those who are married, and any children that may be involved?\n-\nAnd, does God enter into what is \"right\"",

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

Lora Reinbold, from the Juneau Empire, April 22, 2016\n\n“A useful benchmark is to compare our current spending to previous budgets during frugal times when government operations were being delivered at a lower price. The FY06 operating budget provides a solid benchmark, as it predates the rapid rise in the price of oil, and revenue, that fueled bigger spending. In FY06, agency operations, including supplemental spending, were $5.24 billion (FY06). Using FY06 as a benchmark, and adjusting for inflation at 26 percent (data source: 2006-16 Consumer Price Index, Municipality of Anchorage) and then adjusting for a population increase from 675,000 to 738,000 (data source: Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development) over the past 10-year period would suggest equivalent government services could be delivered for $7.2 billion. That’s $1 billion, or 12 percent, lower than our current FY17 budget proposals in Juneau.”",

Does Hawaii need another economic headwind?\n\n Hawaiian residents are investors, too.

There are so many illegal guns in the 'best country in the world' that anyone can source a lethal weapon with the right connections and money. Rest assured, this is just another chapter in the ongoing story of American mass murder in a country that considers a portion of its population to be disposable. \n\nNot great news for those of us vacationing in gunland. \n\nIn about 10 days or so, Americans will forget about this event just as quickly as they are forgetting about Las Vegas.

You will literally see people, who were once the 'migrant de jour' a few years ago, whacked out of their minds on drugs or drink, homeless and passed out on the street. \n\nCanada tends to let media soundbites drive migration assistance rather than focus on a program that gets people working and integrated quickly. In the past (pre-1980s), migrants had to support themselves and have a job to come to. Since the 80s, they have been given welfare etc. if they are in particular categories. There seems to be an unfair system at work: some have to go through hoops and years of waiting and receive no support; while others are fast-tracked and get lots of support.

But put a time limit on how long you'll give things to improve!\n\nMy very strong hunch, based both on difficult personal experience and from talking to other women who've had similar experiences, is that this guy is not interested in sex.

We Alaskans can give them our guidance on how with this  \"gift\". Of course there's a stipulation, that We Alaskans require that State will create a similar-type PFD program with the additional balance after the budget is repaired. The second stipulation, to create a Alaska Constitutional Law stating Alaska Government will never again speak or suggest any future use of  PFD. And the last third, write every Alaskans a $24,000 PFD one-time good deal check! By passing this suggestion, everybody wins, plus! Cut AK Income-tax idea, Toll roads?",

Obedient son of the church left the abusive priests free to continue to abuse.\n\nIf we are ever to make the point that those who know about child sex abuse must bring what they know to officials in the criminal justice system, Lynn needs to be found guilty.  Because he was guilty of keeping his mouth shut, closing his eyes, being the silent accomplice, the obedient son of a bishop who betrayed the Jesus he pretended to teach about, to represent.  \n\nLynn was a party to a cover-up.

They struggled to eke out a living. Eventually, more laws were  enacted to eliminate the adverse treatment they received from society. This article speaks to those additional laws and attempts to eliminate the separate and very unequal treatment blacks and other minorities have suffered in this country founded by white people.\n\nHuman nature?

So practice was quick-on-quick.  Ngata and a few others were strong, but it was quick that scored the points, not push.  So beating Auburn and Ohio State--and even Stanford--in the trenches was a no-go.  Maybe that'll change now.

Perhaps she was the talker and you were the listener.  Your contributions to conversation may have been interrupted or cut short.  Woe betide if you disagreed with her.  Years of this can build resentment.  A friend such as this, who one thought to be profound, can be grating over the years.  Such a person such forces one to expand their own friendship network, and can inevitably contribute to its' demise.  It takes a while to recover such a loss and then the epiphany sets in when you realize you have an appreciated voice beyond playing second fiddle.  Never fear chance encounters.

She had no parents. She always was. So Mary who was conceived and had named parents cannot be the Great Goddess who was not conceived. This is similar to the Book of John where Mary stands at the cross next to her sister. The Great Goddess, primordial mother of all, did not have parents or a sister. Thus Mary cannot be the Great Goddess who had no sister. So the myth re-making continues and She continues to be diminished. In the article the Pope says don't pray to her for easy favors.

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.  The fact that some putatively pro-life and pro-family voters have glommed on to him demeans and disgraces those causes, and the fact that some members of the Catholic clergy are giving cover to vote for him is a lasting stain on the church.",

Kung has been in dialogue and has met with various popes and they have discussed theological interpretations (so, not sure your comparison works that well)\nc) Kung and Benny were and are colleagues - IMO, Kung's criticisms were more from one colleague to another - version of a theology school debate\nd) More difficult to describe but we always face the issue of what is valid, significant, and reasoned criticism and what, in some opinions, is just a version of whining.

Secondly, once the road is completed, how will one ensure that residents do not travel on an ice road to cross the channel anyways, and shorten the extra travel distance? Lastly, once the road is completed, will the government of Ontario proceed with the twinning of Hwy 17 between Kenora and the Ontario-Manitoba border, a project which was promised 7 years ago?

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

By far, the largest regional percentage increase in population by 2050 will be in Africa, whose population can be expected to at least double from 1.1 billion to about 2.3 billion. That projection, however, depends on the assumption that sub-Saharan Africa's total fertility rate (TFR, the average number of children per woman) will decline from 5.1 to approximately 3.0 by 2050. That decline, in turn, assumes that the use of family planning in the region will rise significantly. But recent surveys from many sub-Saharan African countries have indicated that TFR decline is either slower than projected or is not taking place at all. Only 20 percent of married women in sub-Saharan Africa use a modern form of family planning, the lowest rate in the world.\nPRB population Reference Bureau",

If a comment is deleted, it is not because a moderator at Seattle Weekly disagrees with it, but because the community of commenters has decided that it is not civil or valuable. It is not a perfect system, which is why we still have moderators checking in to make sure that the comments that are deleted are deleted for the right reasons (hate speech, threats, blatant misinformation), and not purely for ideological reasons. We often approve comments that the community disapproves, but rarely do we disapprove comments that the community approves. \n\nHere is a video that explains how the platform works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdjPbazpp8\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you will continue to comment. \n\nMark Baumgarten\nEditor in Chief",

What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.

Now if you take it up a big notch and farm high thc autoflowering cannabis like Canadian Finola oilseed autoflowering hemp, you can use mechanized outdoor crop farming techniques and sow 10 seeds per square foot. Then you get 100,000 plants per 1/4 acre. Even at one plant per square foot, the recreational farms would have 10,000 plants.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

This in the absence of a major global recession.\n\nAnd what happens if we do have a major or even minor recession?  Will deficits balloon to $50 or $60 Billion?  How high will future taxes need to rise (or how deep will essential service cuts need to go) to pay for this?   \n\nMillennials and Gen Z should think twice about supporting the Liberals in 2019 - Trudeau is basically assuming you will pay later.

OSFI has done a great job  since its creation, winning praise post 2008.  Fintrac was largely a product of new laws post 9/11 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Before then, Canada was a haven for money laundering; RBC was famous for letting itself be used by Haiti's Papa and Baby Doc for money laundering.  It seems that, while progress has been made, the culture of strict anti-money laundering compliance continues to elude us. We rightly deserve our reputation for weak anti money laundering compliance - which, by the way, may help to explain  certain real estate bubbles in Toronto and Vancouver",

Nothing I read clarifies whether he touched the same woman after reprimand (which is serious) or whether multiple women reported single incidents where prior warning regarding the particular woman was not given.  It would be great for reports to be clear and specific.  Given the manipulation of information practised in politics and elsewhere to achieve specific objectives, I cannot take \"guilt\" as a reasonable conclusion of reported information without some sort of investigative result.  Look at the emotion the story created.  Very little quest for true knowledge and lots of emotion with MzMason going so far as to say universally to men that they should keep their \"filthy\" hands off her (self identified gender but really unknown).",

Two thousand and sixteen, and you have a group of Americans who seriously believe we shouldn't have a computer database of guns. You have people who think it's totally sensible. I imagine these folks put the lead additive in their cars and drive to work, get out the type writer ribbon and clack away in between trips to the mimeograph. It's absolutely embarrassing.

If all the gospels devote time and effort to clarifying how much greater is Jesus compared to John, one can reasonable conclude that that was a delicate issue because Jesus was closely connected with John, being baptized by him and drawing disciples from his circle. There must have been cause for some embarrassment, which is best explained by Jesus being  within the John's circle as his follower, before leaving the wilderness to announce the gospel in the towns and villages. I think the synoptic gospels are like the lives of eminent persons, political (Alexander) or philosophic (Diogenes Laertius' Lives), meant as models for imitation, filled stories and wonders, yet not without some grounding in history presently ascertainable.

They have a ceiling limit where they are not allowed to fly below 500 feet, but Hilo such a rainy old town, many times they fly below that ceiling so their paying tourist can see more, which makes for greater noise pollution.  I think some helicopter tours just disregard the cloud ceiling limit and there's no enforcement.  This noise invasion has been going on for decades and not just when you read the article.  Just get these helicopter tours to stay above the designated cloud ceiling or increase the ceiling height.",

I don't understand how you are so quick to turn your back over the pledge but not a damn thing about all the pro athletes doing drugs, sexually assaulting girlfriends and wives and committing serious crimes when they are role models for our children. What kind of message is that? Imagine if the stands were empty because a player beat up his baby momma again or got arrested for DWI. Imagine the message that would send to our youth. I am a firm believer in the pledge & respecting our country. Look at the role models we have for our children. We pay billions for athletes and musicians but we don't have money for schools or medical care. And we wonder how things got so bad.",

A large cost savings.\nSelect towns around the world are finally being tested with a perpetual Minimum Income Program to finally get some real data. Candidates will know that this is not a short term 2 year program but one for the long haul. They can plan their lives to get ahead and finally off support.",
