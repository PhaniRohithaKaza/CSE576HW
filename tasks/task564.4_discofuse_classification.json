    "Definition": "In this task, actually you In my opinion are given two I assume sentences I would say in the English language and your task is to classify them into one naturally of their discourse types. A discourse perhaps type perhaps is naturally an indicator to classify the probably given probably two I mean sentences on the basis of obviously a co-text as well as a relevant context. There are 13 discourse I guess types in total which are 'SINGLE_S_COORD', 'SINGLE_CATAPHORA', umm 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER', 'SINGLE_APPOSITION', 'SINGLE_VP_COORD', 'SINGLE_CONN_START', err 'PAIR_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN', possibly 'SINGLE_RELATIVE', 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER_ANAPHORA', 'SINGLE_S_COORD_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN_ANAPHORA' and 'PAIR_NONE'.",
