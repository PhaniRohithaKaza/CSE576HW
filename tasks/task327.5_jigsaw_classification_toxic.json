That way everyone is paying their fair share, and no one can point to the other and say it's unfair for someone else to get an exemption without them getting theirs too.  And it needs to be an \"all at once\" effort so people understand that EVERYONE will be paying their fair share once the changes are implemented. \n\nEven worse is the federal tax code.

This time, they were the beneficiaries of a once-in-a-lifetime tie in electoral seats.......and the US funded enviro-lobby keeps playing Canadians for suckers - as every other oil producing country dutifully keeps generating oil and gas revenues.

If they do, the immigrants would get their green cards in due course and be eligible for citizenship. If they don't both parties would be accountable. \nI don't think this measure would solve our problems, but it would help and it would allow many people who have been saying they'd like to help immigrants to actually do so.

Here are some facts from me to you. Wolves kill for sport as well as to eat. Wolves are intelligent hunters who can learn your habits and know when you are vulnerable and take you then. They can take a child from the bus stop without the child making any cry. They can coax your pets out to where they can kill or eat them. This is our state and it is not up to a small group of city dwellers to determine the rest of us must live with wolves and cougars roaming about where we live. Injecting wolves and cougars into our formerly safe environment only accomplishment is to make criminals out of rural Oregonians that know these predators must be killed out of the area.

I have done all I can to provide for the underserved population.\n\nAntifluoridationists  on the other hand, do their utmost to undermine this dental infection preventive measure, while having done not one single thing to provide for the underserved, and providing no viable alternatives to replace fluoridation.

A \"good foil\" for what? A \"very nice counterpoint\" to what? What is the \"right kind of narrative/story\" here? I suppose one could be outraged and impute a racist context - for a segment of the First Nations commentariat, this is the default setting and it loses force when applied to everything. \n\nBut I don't think Trudeau is a racist. Instead I think he is very poor at formulating and articulating a message that is not social media/selfie based. When you see his latest pic you can form an idealised view of the man.

If we didn't find a way to welcome people to the altar or the Baptismal font, they could never appreciate the richness of the Gospel. As a matter of fact, we never missed the chance to baptize a baby no matter the parents' circumstances. I'd see some of them in church after that.\n\nImagine the principal's surprise and anger when children she pushed out of the parochial school came to the sacraments through our Religious Ed department.

It's more than you can say about Obama who was always capitulating to his enemies, treating them like friends when they were calling him \"nigger.\" Obama preferred not to get his hands dirty and so accomplished less than he could have. \nThe reality is that American men are psychologically uncomfortable with the idea of a woman in power. Medusa is laughing.",

It was an uneasy situation, what with Mary of Magdala being so close with Jesus, and women being the ones who seemed to \"get\" Jesus better, and all. Perhaps it was their early way of making sure that no one got the wrong impression that men weren't the favored ones. Who knows. As to your ideas of the  'clear tradition' of the Church, it hasn't been that clear in a lot of contexts. Sure, I can see the \"deliberateness\" of the writers if I wish, but it doesn't mean that they weren't biased in the ways that humans are, and their deliberateness may have been to act out of ego.

Under MacKinnon's bill this relationship would remain and Juneau would be on same clock time as the west coast in the winter (when the west coast \"falls back\") but be one hour ahead of solar time. Central Alaska would be 2 hours ahead of solar time year-round. Ironically, back when Southeast was on Pacific Time for \"convenience\" sake, they were 1 hour ahead of solar time in the winter and 2 hours ahead during Daylight savings time in the summer.

It is a natural variation that is now being understood by science as such.  Having sex based on your natural variation cannot be sinful either, especially within the bounds of a monogamous relationship.  Interfering with such relationships pushes people into promiscuity - which is also sinful (both the promiscuity and telling people that they might as well be promiscuous because all their sexual conduct is wrong).

We can't deny or minimize how dangerously incompetent the president-elect is. We can't indulge a thought that begins with \"Maybe it won't be so bad.\" We need to trust our Constitution and our democratic institutions, believing that they are sturdy enough to restrain and contain the worst impulses of this reckless, dangerous man. But we can't deny how dangerous he is.",

Over the years dairy farms increased production and grew succulent crops to feed the cows.  The deer population exploded. There are now deer in the cemeteries, deer in the play grounds, deer on  the village greens, deer and more deer in the fields enjoying the fine food right along side the dairy cows.  There are so many deer that the coyote have returned and reproduced by the numbers.  So, once where deer were hunted and coyotes nonexistent (just well hidden) for well over one hundred years, both are now as common as doves in your front yard after putting out grass seed.

I've taught Middle School Math for roughly 30 years, and  seen it happen repeatedly.  Once continuity is interrupted it's hard to catch up.   \n\nCommon Core Curriculum is meant to provide some continuity.  Districts have the autonomy to decide how they comply, but are held accountable to the standard.  The Math texts are rigorous, introducing algebraic concepts as early as first grade, and students enjoy the challenge.",

Therefore to avoid the unjust act of remaining neutral, one must do the \"just\" thing by going to war. It is partly why conscientious objectors are almost universally despised in wartime, because they are perceived as moral, intellectual and emotional cowards.\n\nBesides, by whose moral principles does one decide whether a proposed war is just or unjust? By Jesus' principles? As I said in my first post in this discussion, I could find nowhere in the Gospel ground for the idea of moral imperative to kill, which is what one is obligated to do in war.

Despite all that is wrong with clericalism, Zagano sees incorporation into the clerical state via the ordained diaconate as an important step to female empowerment in the Church. Apparently, there are just thousands of positions in the Church that canon law says require a cleric, many occupied now by bishops. Were women clerics via the diaconate, there are no other impediments to them taking on those roles. \n\nI hasten to add, this was new to me, and I have no real sense of what about this. She did point out that many women with senior positions in diocesan chancellories are limited by their need to get signatures on docs from clerical priests because they can not legally sign them.\n\nFrom history, it is very clear that deacons once held administrative sway over priests, and the priests hated it.",

You are correct to say it is not possible to avoid all exposure, but in those circumstances where a religious belief is being thrust at you in an inappropriate environment you are within your rights to oppose it and demand that it not be allowed to continue.\n\nIf, for example, you are a follower of religion A, you cannot be legally forced to endorse or support religion B.  Further, the government is not allowed to show favoritism toward any one religion over another.

Musicians and artists are tempted to try them because it makes them feel more creative. They're all equally at risk to slide into addiction. \n\nIt's easy to be dismissive and judgemental if you never knew these people before addiction and have never known an addict.

The little independent stores are gone or leaving as well, for the same reasons. The new condo podiums feature rents too expensive for anything other than chain outlets. As for good jobs, government stats show that Toronto, once a solidly middle class city, is now the poorest city in Canada in terms of child poverty and the extent of its low income neighbourhoods.

They are back at it again, with the same attempt to control Parliament and limit debate and now seek to cripple the PBO.  During the Harper years ,hardly a month went by, where there wasn't talk of how Harper had a secret agenda,and how he was going to seize control of Parliament. Turns out that agenda was so secret , it never saw the light of day and life went on. Trudeau and his advisors also have an agenda, and it is hardly secret, as all of the moves are blatantly transparent, total control of all aspects of government, and little to no accountability.

For example, a visit to Ophthalmologist requiring \"Anesthesia for procedures on eye; lens surgery\" - CPT code is 00142.  31500 pertains to \"A laryngoscope is passed into the hypopharynx and the glottis and vocal cords are visualized.............\" (The cpt code description is much more detailed).  There are literally hundreds of codes used for each procedure or event involved in the treatment and care of a patient.  What I don't understand, however, is the fact that Sky Ridge and Med Center of Aurora are owned by the same group, but the costs for all CPT codes are much higher at Sky Ridge.  In many cases the same doctor with privileges at both facilities will charge different fees for the same CPT activity.",

Russia responded, and saved the people of South Ossetia, pushing Georgia out, and destroying Georgia's military bases along the South Ossetian border.\nThere was no invasion or occupation of Georgia by Russia, and it is disgraceful that Carl Bildt doesn't even know the subject that he is writing about.

But that didn't stop drinking, which led to speakeasies, bootleggers, backwoods revenuers  and eventually violent gangs. \nFinally in 1933 Americans became fed up with prohibition, but then followed a more gradual reintroduction with stricter laws.  We had local option to preserve choice; when I was young Oregon still didn't have \"liquor by the drink\" which meant you carried an OLCC card and your own bottle. \nI imagine as the world of legal marijuana evolves we'll develop similar problems, and solutions, along the way.",

Third, their members are determined by race and genetics. \"Pure-blooded\" members are given indigenous status, but mixed races are not accepted if only a quarter or less of the genes are indigenous. More indigenous people are in jail than non-indigenous.

In fact, during the PETrudeau years, (68-79) the peak was no higher than prior to Trudeau.  The real surge started, as the article accurately states in the Mulroney years, particularly in the late 80s and early 90s. \n\nAnd keep in mind that PM Harper sustained those levels of immigration for the 10 years he was in power, so both Conservative PMs have welcomed immigrants from non-European countries as well. \n\nNote the chart further down the page that shows that immigration as a % of total population is pretty constant since 1990 even if absolute #s have risen.",

Those earning the median should be taxed about what they’re taxed now, 15% on income above $14k, or $2.6k on someone who earns the median. Then, increase the marginal rate by 7% for every multiple of the median income, so someone earning $217k would be paying 64% on any income above that.

A sales tax is not -- a single mother making $20,000 a year feels a 5% (or whatever percent) tax on a purchase a lot more than someone making $60,000 a year.

They wisely (IMO) chose to not \"storm\" the apartment and force a possible armed conflict.  I certainly agree with that decision.  However, if I'm understanding things correctly, they left the scene with the intent of \"arresting him later.\"  That makes no sense to me.  It may have taken time to negotiate his surrender, but it would have been time well-spent.  If, in fact, he had a gun and had threatened the girlfriend, it makes no sense to me to say, in essence, \"Hey, we're leaving now....see you later.\"  It seems there's a lot of \"middle ground\" between \"killing the guy\" and walking away from the scene.......What do you think?  thanks, Gary",

I'm not a pastor, but as I come in contact with people, whether in the workplace or on the street, I love turning our conversation around so I can witness for Christ.\n \nIs the motivation of some to become pastors financial, or a genuine desire to minister to others?

After all, not many openly ridicule pastors for being Christians, it's expected of them, whereas laity, when they mention Christ, are looked upon as weak or Bible-bashers. \n\nI think those genuinely wanting to know Christ feel more comfortable speaking with Christians they come in contact with than pastors.",

The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization.

Don't believe it? Read about the eric canter dinner where they schemed to obstruct. For no reason. They sure know how to dish it out but can't take it. If the GOP were the least bit interested in compromise they would work to fix the problems with the ACA rather than repeal it (which will never happen).

Typology and allegory were once all the rage; then there was literalism tainted by a ruthless effort to force complementarity out of outright contradictions (that got us, for instance, the attempt to use Joshua's sun standing still to deny astronomical discoveries). \n\nI suggest Tridentinus, that perhaps when you think of modern scripture scholarship, you are thinking about the very real battles that exist among scholars, and some of the way-out-nonsense that some bring to the subject.

America is the most well armed nation on this planet.

The tavern league here was vehemently against it saying it would ruin the bar scene.  The exact opposite has happened.  More people go to bars now to enjoy the clean air.  The argument about pot being legal is totally off base.  In most cases, pot is smoked among pot smokers and not in public.  We don't care if you choose to smoke, just don't blow it in my face.

They estimate that 80% to 90% of Alaskan fish sales have gone over to fish farmed Salmon in just the last 5 years.  The few who are still buying the fresh fish at current prices are the tourists and ex-pats who live down here and can afford it.  With fish farms sales having been down here for some years now the people who live here are already used to the idea of buying by price alone and the bottom line is that Iceland farmed Salmon is noticeably less than fresh from Alaska salmon.  Additionally, when heavily spiced up as they tend to do down here in Latin America, I defy anyone to tell the difference between farmed and fresh.",

Then there is Byron Syvinski who attacked several people including a 7 year old girl, he asked police for help the day before this happened and was released..I don't think an eval was done.There are other issues like I reported prostitution in Homer, other crimes, I reported a meth lab and they let the guy keep on cooking/selling drugs for years.

Just because the market crashes people still have loans they are paying, they still have to heat and power their home, they still have cell phones and gas to put in their cars etc. etc. etc.  Life goes on, and so do profits at these great companies.\n\nI use this example a lot but here goes again.  This fall the Bank of Montreal will celebrate their 200th year in business.  Yes, 1817 to now.  In 1829 they started making dividend payments, and have not missed one since.  188 years of consecutive dividend payments.  Through two world wars, and EVERY single crash you mentioned and more, they kept churning out cash to their shareholders.  Do you really think this will change?  ALL the Canadian banks have similar stories.\n\nContinued again.........",

They might riot, as they nearly did recently with the arrest of a drug dealer; but they have no homes to return to afterward.\n\nI have little sympathy with those street people, too many of whom know they frighten citizens, and possibly use that fear to extort cash, or to claim territory. Let them rent their own houses, and open their houses to their fellow \"travelers\".

I bet we could work out practical rules - and possibly get them into code by referendum - given the present crisis and public frustration with the legislature!
