Mineral deposits.   So when we asked for statehood we agreed that the STATE would retain ownership of the mineral tights.  Hence our constitution incorporates this mandate in dealing with mineral rights, holding in Section 8.11 that even when land was granted, the mineral rights were RESERVED by the State.    The State is required by section 8.2 of the constitution the develop is resources \"for the maximum benefit of its people.\"  We have never been \"owners\".",

When you have your body in the right place and in the correct football position, a positive outcome is much more likely than when you are out of position running around like a chicken with your head cut off.  And that difference is not 'will', but rather knowledge and execution.   \n\nA great example of this is Utah's first touchdown, on which Troy Dye never got himself into football position, but rather tripped over his own feet awkwardly looking and allowing the touchdown.  He was running fast (too fast) and no one has ever questioned Dye's 'will'.  But if Troy had executed with his body in a football position he would have most likely made the tackle for a loss on that play.\n\nThe Ducks executed better.  Only 5 penalties.  Defensive line bodies lower than the Utah offensive linemen and staying in their assigned gaps.  And win or lose it was fun to watch.",

He has issued non-stop white supremacist dog whistles at his rallies about \"dangerous\" blacks and immigrants.  He was enthusiastically supported by the KKK's David Duke, who celebrated his promise to \"Take America Back.\"  The first of Donald's three wives, Ivana, said that he kept a copy of Hilter's speeches in his bed table. His father was a Klan member. He has selected a known white supremacist, Steve Bannon,  to be his Chief Strategist.  The FBI has already reported a sharp increase in the number of  hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, immigrants and other minorities from those emboldened by his rhetoric. These people  are afraid for their safety.  He has also degraded & demeaned women on a regular basis. Wake up! If it looks like a white supremacist, and acts like  a white supremacist- it is a white supremacist.",

Islam in North America is called the \"Religion of Peace\" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system.

There isn't a low cost spay for them. SPCA doesn't spay rabbits even though a vet I know offered to teach the vet there how to do it. The least expensive rabbit spay is about $280 & some vets charge over $500. Only the richest of people can usually afford that. I don't necessarily agree that people should not have pets they can't afford. To some, esp the elderly, it is really important to have a companion. There are many doe rabbits that are dumped because they can be cranky if they aren't spayed, plus they're more likely to get cancer. Quit gouging me!",

It is that that violates church law from those days.\n- What also violated church law was the bishop pretending that civil law in these matters had no bearing on the consequence of their decisions. That is, civil law per canon law is not to be ignored.\n- Even ArchRaymond, transferred from LaCrosse, moved out of St. Louis, dismissed from the Apostolic Signatura and other Holy See offices and committees, now a sidelined chaplain to the Knights and Dames of Malta, noted at one time that if the bishops had followed canon law as it was promulgated in 1983 much of the harm would have been stemmed and  ameliorated.",

Will their be multi billion suits and settlements like in Tobacco?\n\nBut Alaska has this all solved so why worry be happy.",

In fact, he's referring to deliberate government policy that small business owners were encouraged to pursue.  Moreover, and most importantly, these rules provide no after-tax advantages to individuals.  Market forces would quickly erode any such riskless advantage.  As an example, imagine plumbers suddenly paid no tax - would plumbers be wealthier in the long run.  No.  More plumbers would enter the market, driving down prices (to the good of consumers) and profits, until plumbers earned exactly as much  as they originally did relative to other professions.  The only difference is that we'd have more plumbers.  Suddenly charging those plumbers an \"equivalent\" tax rate would amount to a dramatic reduction in their fair wage.  That's the reason these tax changes are fundamentally unjust.",

If defence counsel is actually making an allegation that the judge hearing the trial - in fact, any judge hearing the trial - is so biased by his training sessions that no fair trial can be held, then perhaps it's admissible.  I doubt it, though.  I'd say it's the well-known \"fishing expedition,\" and should be dismissed.\n\n2.

Per the Koran it is okay to kill them all; especially Jews. \n\nThe problem with the Rohingya Muslims, sometimes referred to as the most prosecuted people on earth, has a \nrather obvious solution; they can abandon Islam. \n\nOf course, this is an impossible task as they have all been indoctrinated in the terrible cult from birth.

He was a great father to her.  Whatever Hunter wanted, Hunter got.  Fred did not pay child support?  That is a lie.  Was he late periodically?  Yes he was, like many working fathers trying to survive.  He works off of commission as a real estate broker, but he would pay child support, and regularly.  What the article does not you is about how he indulged Hunter.  The I-phone he bought her at the age of 12, or the I-pad, the lap tops, the designer clothes, and nice shoes. \n\nDid he file bankruptcy? Yeah he did.  So what! He filed just like Stuart Emmons and lots of other people.  Him and thousands of others, who freakin cares?   At the time of this incident Hunter was going through a normal stage that a thousand other 16 year-old girls go through.  (To be continued running out of space)",

If advisors are supposed to act in their clients best interest then many are either ignorant or in conflict of interest. Alternatively, one could pay a few hundred a year and subscribe to a well respected investor newsletter and simply buy and hold a basked to blue chip dividend paying stocks and pay almost no fees, and probably have better long term returns.

The data sample is too small.   5 years of significant increases in occurrence (perhaps per capital, but we don't really know) is more likely to lead to a casual link.  \n\nI am willing to accept it wasn't marijuana related.

Therefore talking about unity between \"Protestants\" as a general term, and Roman Catholics, is not productive.\n It does however make a useful cudgel for Catholic trads to bash any ecumenical efforts. These efforts have borne fruit when they proceed on specific denominational tracks. I think Kung is steeped in German, Swiss and European religious culture.

White folks did build our racist heritage. We have been working on becoming \"a more perfect union\" ever since the founding of the nation.

Clearly, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism, rape, or murder. This country is proof. The beauty of white racism is that it allows the average white person to go through life thinking they are innocent while collecting their white privilege.

Because interest rates are near zero, and assuming a 50/50 allocation, I'd have expected a positive return of about 6%.\n\nERS probably has about half dozen independent investment managers.

People are using \"white privilege\" as a pejorative term -- as did a letter writer after yours who stated he was glad I was offended.  My letter addressed that. I am an ally against racism, I've tasted a smidge and don't like it. I'm not minimizing it but trying to explain that I understand it a small bit, and take it to heart.  So why do people use it pejoratively as that other letter writer did?  Why offend an ally?  Why use it as derogatory name for all whites. Why write off anyone who is concerned about such issues.

Consider this- while only around 20% of businesses are small businesses (and that number has been dwindling) they still create 2 out of every 3 jobs in this country. But as COSTS rise for those businesses, they are unable to hire more people or give more hours when their revenues and overhead no longer result in enough profit to operate and live. And as the studies in the article seem to debate big business vs small business in the marketplace, I find myself a bit curious why so many would want to give the leg up to big business by mandating an unsustainable payroll requirement for smaller ones, along with the enormous tax burden the small business pays compared to the larger ones? The larger businesses have the cash flow to pay more, but then who pays for that? We all do, and COSTS continue to rise. You can't create value out of nothing by killing the job creator.",

First, my experience suggests people self-identify today for reasons of pride in their Hawaiian ancestors.

George Bernard Shaw long ago observed, “Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  They may have different tastes.”  Social good, as in the determination of a just income distribution, is an abstraction of some kind from the individual values of the members of the society.  But this abstraction can only be based on interpersonally observed behavior, as in market purchases or voting, not on the full range of an individual’s feelings.  As is by now well known, attempts to form social judgments by aggregating individual expressed preferences always lead to the possibility of paradox.\n\nThus there cannot be a completely consistent meaning to collective rationality.\"\nThank you Sir",

Moreover, this writer even strains her so-called analysis further by attempting to compare the NFL protest led by CK to the black community's criticism of Betsy DeVos...any one knows that this criticism is based on DeVos's widely held and inaccurate attacks on the public school system in favor of the old 'private school' scheme that his be used to prolong discrimination against blacks all over the country.

Now imagine you’re a male celebrity with sex as easily available as donuts. Extrapolate. Now reevaluate your moral superiority.",

Uncertainty is never good for financial markets. It will drive more global savings into the United States, pushing up the dollar and thereby making American exports less competitive internationally.\n\nQuestion: And what about American workers? Will they benefit?\nAnswer: No. Trump is doing absolutely nothing to create more and better jobs. His bullying of auto and appliance makers is purely for show. A trade war would hurt American jobs. A higher dollar will hurt jobs as well. Trump’s repeal of Obamacare will harm millions of American workers, who will have to pay more for health insurance. \n\nQuestion: So the “Trump rally” has nothing to do with the real economy?\nAnswer: Absolutely nothing.",

That being said, if the US does extend Buy American policies, outside of efforts in the WTO and the courts via NAFTA, reciprocity is the only unitary measure through which we can even hope to return to the \"free trade\" status quo. Reciprocity via Buy Canadian is not about \"winning\", it's about responding accordingly to motivate the US to return to more desirable trade relations. What does the author suggest we do instead?  Just bend over and accept it? That is not the answer. If we want to change US trade behavior we must not only respond in kind, we must cooperate with like-minded nations seeking to constrain US bilateral economic behavior,  working in concert to change their behavior. In conducting trade only with nations that promote free trade, we fight the temptation towards insularity and tariff raising which led to WWII. We must act now!",

Oh, yes, I know more about Islam, than the Muslims do! - that its purpose is control - through lies, manipulation and submission of all others by force. No; you cannot say this! - it is Islamophobic! - oh, how dear.   Why cannot we have a fair, and honest discussion, regarding the pitfalls of this horrendous religion? - because the Islamists will shut the conversation down with lies - whatever works...as is the case in Tacqiya.

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

So, for example, the first new bracket is $250,000/year. Everything from $249,999 and down will still be taxed at 33%; everything over will be taxed at the new 37% level. The entire set of changes are as follows:\n\n$250,000+/year will be 37%.\n$500,000+/year will be 43%.\n$2,000,000+/year will be 48%.\n$10,000,000+/year will be 52%\n\nI would also point out that his proposed taxation levels, to accomplish all of this, are almost exactly the same as what Reagan repeatedly fought for.",

BC has a good credit rating.  If John Horgan and the BC NDP were to run large deficits then the BC government could face a credit downgrade and end up having to pay more interest on their bonds.  If that happened then everyone in BC would have to pay more taxes just to pay the interest on the BC government bonds.\n\nIncreased bond issuance from having deficits every year along with having to pay higher interest rates due to a credit downgrade would mean more and more tax revenue would go just to paying interest on the provincial debt instead of going to pay for government programs and services.\n\nSo I would rather have Christy Clark win the election and continue to run balanced budgets instead of taking a chance on John Horgan and the NDP.  I don't believe the NDP platform can be put into effect without producing large deficits.",

His Holiness obviously thinks all Christians should get along, must get along as the People of God united by the Holy Spirit by Baptism. The Vatican radio website has the English trans. of the Papal homily, along with an interesting interview with the Dean of the Abbey.

Given a chose between knowledge and wisdom, our preference ought to be, say I, wisdom.\n\nLet's flip this on its head.

Also, not everyone parking money in a corporation to invest in real estate is \"rich\".  While the government is spinning all of this as being \"fair\" to the middle class, this is really about a government that is desperately in need of money because of it's massive over-spending.   Saying it's a tax on the \"rich\" is just a way to spin it to get voter sympathy.   These measures will effect income earners who make like 125,000 in Toronto and Vancouver, and who want to try and invest some money for the future.   That kind of salary in those cities already leaves one in a very, very tight spot if they have kids and want to save for the future.

Canada and the US should become one political entity, possibly with Quebec in a Schengen-like arrangement, and restoring North America as one political space as it had been for centuries.

Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2.

Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\".

For others it may be a struggle that requires step by step instruction.   For both groups, I agree that committing certain basic skills to memory is key, and repeated practice is necessary - if only so one learns to avoid sloppy mistakes that we can all make.    As to textbooks, I've worked through a couple of them, and they've been so dumbed down, with every single step written out to the point where the kids no longer need to think that they make the teaching harder rather than easier.   Solutions will come from tackling all these problems, from better trained teachers who can recognize the students who \"get it\" to those who need more coaching and step by step guidance, to better textbooks, and a willingness to ensure the fundamentals are ingrained early on",

Mr. Kesey's drug use is not exactly a secret; nor is the fact that he, by all accounts I've heard and read, was a decent man.  Additionally, his literary achievements are obvious.  I think the support for naming the square for him DOES represent considering the \"whole man.\"  Those who scream \"he was a druggie.....don't honor him\" are, IMO, focusing only only one facet of that \"whole man\" you reference.  regards, Gary Crum",

There are 20% of the old growth forests left.  5 million acres in Oregon, with virtually no loss since 1992.   You are correct about the terrain .  That's largely because people did not want to build cities, farms or even houses on that terrain.  The change of the land use (Oregon's old growth forests used to cover 14.2M acres around the turn of the century and now cover 5M) is due to a number of things including people settling the land, fire, logging, pathogens, etc.\nThe history of Oregon's land is rich and fascinating, but the fact remains that the timber industry cannot currently mill old growth logs.  Their mills are tooled for second growth.  They could not run a 60-inch-diameter log through their mills if they wanted to.  Andy Kerr's depiction of timber companies wanting to chop down old growth forests with bulldozers at the ready is a false one. He's either out of touch, or trying to incite the uneducated.",

And  these sicko Muslims think they will go to paradise and get bunch of virgins  if they go and commit suicide while murdering scores of children and even babies.  The last suicide bomber got praise from his sister, having made  it to paradise.  To not be an infidel you have to be Sunni or Shiite; but you have to be in the right place, or you die. And I hope that mute p***y  Steve Jensen grows a pair.",

Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens. As to gentrification, cause gentrification; what causes gentrification is rich people moving here.

The system is so absurd that some sources of power, like solar, tend to be more available at times the government wants people consuming less power, like weekday afternoons. And who can predict when the wind will blow? Further, nuclear power, which Ontario uses for its base load, isn't particularly flexible and is neither any cheaper nor more expensive to produce depending on the time of day. Gas and hydroelectric are used for peaking, but as the system is overproducing electricity in general in comparison to demand, TOU pricing may actually be undermining the economic viability of these power sources.",

Nobody gets upset about NK.  And yes, it is time for the US to retreat from paying for the world's wars.  Contrary to your suggestion about other countries arming themselves, we would likely see greater attention to peace and nonviolent conflict resolution.  They do not want to pay for their own standing armies.  Confrontation is fine if someone else is paying for it.  Trump's retreat from carte blanche funding of world conflict is better for all.

The second rape involved a 28 year old Moslem male who raped a mentally disabled white woman in August, 2016.\nInterestingly, these rapes have been downplayed by the Mayor and the police in Twin Falls, possibly due to the influence of Ulukaya and the growing number of Moslem refugees.

What are we supposed to think when he gets Smith-Pelly at the deadline two years ago, and Ott, Martinsen and Dwight King at this year's deadline?

He is strongly anti-development, be it trails, highways (Seward Hwy Upgrades) or anything else.  The proposed trail development by Single Track Advocates that Rick is trying to kill is between Hill Top Ski Area and Basher Drive and is further contained by The Gasline.  Take a minute and look at the area riddled with roads, parking lots, trails, right of ways and a ski area on Google Maps or Google Earth.  According to Google Maps most of the area where new trails are being proposed are within a Couple hundred yards of Basher Drive & a ski area.  This area is busy and well traveled on a daily basis by hikers, runners, bikers on existing trails, after school and college sports programs and a lot of automobile traffic.  Is closing Hill Top Ski Area next?  Wildlife in Anchorage's woods is a reality, what should we should be scared of Rick's ranting/bias.",

The proverbial icing on the faux-feminist cake was the fact that many non-Muslim demonstrators decided to don the hijab, just one of the many symbols of women's oppression under Sharia law and Islam. If the marchers had been truly committed to feminism, they should have demonstrated outside the Saudi, Kuwaiti and other embassies of Muslim-majority countries. Instead of challenging the real threat to women's rights worldwide, the hypocrites decided to attack a soft, non-threatening target in the safe environment of the world's largest democracy.
