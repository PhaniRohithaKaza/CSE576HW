Back then, sovereignty ruled the day and if someone was overstepping their bounds, they got what they were asking for and it was okay.

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others.

Having a gun and knowing how to use it (which this woman clearly did not) significantly increases your chance of survival.\n\nI'm sorry the burglar wasn't hurt, because he'll spend a few years in jail and be out doing this again soon. He probably won't even be charged with the appropriate crime ... which should be attempted murder.\n\nWhen someone burglarizes a house when people are home, they signal their desire to kill those they find within those walls. This is why it's legal to shoot an intruder, because they have signaled that your life is meaningless to them and in doing so they have ceded their own right to life.

But this is the REAL world, SB-21 gave incentives to small fry wildcaters to go for oil by taxpayers picking up 80% of their cost.  To pick up these costs, we have cut employment in the public sector, cut capital investment, cut the PDF dividend check and therefore put Alaska into a recession.

I don't think that patients should be given refills on their pain meds.\nI think it's interesting that one of the reasons many cities have legalized pot is to give addicts a legal alternative to addictive drugs. That idea completely derails the gateway theory but it seems to be helping. I don't think that it's fair to label people who are taking medications \"druggies\". Especially if they're taking prescribed medications. Bullying people and threatening them with incarceration is only going to cause depression and make their problem worse.

I always question to myself why I needed an annulment when I applied for one with my Bishop ( I did because my in-laws would not accept me without it). My logic is this: If the marriage was carried out by mistake, unforeseen at the time, then there is no need for annulment, The Lord knew and He was not there. If there was no mistake then who could annul that union ( I hope that people would not say the Vica on Earth could)?

Then they jackhammered the friezes, dislodged them with crowbars, and pushed the remains inside the building, where they fell to the floor and shattered into pieces.”\nTrump—posing as John Baron, one his fake alter egos told the Times that he had the friezes appraised and found they were “without artistic merit” and weren’t worth the $32,000 he would have to pay to remove them intact.\nBut today he says US culture is being  'ripped apart' by Confederate statue removals.",

It was challenged by the states of Minnesota and Washington on the grounds that the order contravened states' financial rights. And in fact, it's clear that Trump's order would have a financial impact on some states. The legal question, however, is whether Trump's power to prioritize national security outweighs the rights of states to control aspects of their financial independence.

The whole point of the AL footnote is to address those whose lives are in a murky mess: extricating themselves from their relationship and/or living a brother-sister relationship is very complicated if not infeasible.

So the choice becomes either live with it, or try to do away with it completely. \n\n     Getting rid of it isn't a great idea.  In New Brunswick the Irving family owns ALL the print media.  This family pretty much OWNS the province, and if there is ever a story on them, which there often is, the CBC is the only place you hear it.  \n\n    However, even if you like a TV show, its still just a TV show.

Longer total travel times, higher fares, multiple transfers, higher cost of living, etc.  Since it's a replacement system, why even build it if rail worsens the public transit commute?  Yet we got this far without having this question answered because our politicians keep passing it off as an \"alternative\", like it adds another mode of transit option to westside commuters.  If express buses operated concurrently, no one would ride rail.  And that should speak toward the merits (or lackthereof) of the rail project, Mr. Anderson, and why it should be stopped even if \"we get nothing\".",

The college uses an informal ratio of two or three hours for every hour in the classroom for part-timers. The issue though is with full-time faculty, they are well paid for what they do. I've done the math, and the full-timers receive, when compared on an hourly basis, way more than the part-timers, as well as, they have benefits, a pension, and lots of time off. Administration  and full-time faculty costs are very high, and those costs should be examined, with the goal of keeping tuition manageable for our students. Many have to rely on OSAP. So, costs to run the colleges are high, and many students then incur debt to the government to pay for their education. Hmmm...",

Western AK could produce a TON more wind power but right now it would overwhelm the tiny grids they are on.

Lynch may find himself trying to find a team to fit his talents too just like you are saying. These guys aren't dink and dunkers. No one really wants a QB that runs too much. The concussion problems alone league wide pretty much dictates a dink and dunk offense for the QB to get rid of the ball quickly to a series of reads. Once a QB has been in the league for awhile they know how to work a pocket and focus on reads. The question is how long will you wait?

I thought the QB was responsible for that according to your own statements. As for Siemian getting better or worse, I agree that he's looked worse the last 4 games after starting out well in the first 2.

His courage alone in face of the system makes him infinitely more inspiring that this tripe that the G&M peddles. \n\nThis is a professor who has the courage to stand up for his principles, all the way up to the Senate. What's more interesting than this debacle is the joke that is our Senate. The questions he so easily and intellectually dismissed were being facile which to me demonstrates how ineffective the Senate is in tackling complex problems. Where is an article discussing just how simplistic the senators were in face of his questions?\n\nWhat's frankly more pathetic than the Globe painting this man into the same corner as MSM is that it does little to add to the discussion.

Coal is too dirty and too expensive now and not suited to peak load generation.  Renewable energy costs less than other options for peak load generation and its natural availability typically aligns with energy demand but not always.  Gas generation is the main competitor to renewables - it is very expensive but it is definitely available on short notice.  \n\nI've read that places like Vermont, Denmark, Spain and Portugal are already using wind energy for base load generation so renewables can be used this way too.

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

If they abided by the hunting ethic that a hunter should identify what he/she is about to shoot before he/she shoots, they could easily tell the difference between a gray whale and a beluga. A gray whale's face is extraordinarily long due to the fact that it is a baleen whale and the gray whale is up to 50 feet in length. A beluga has a stubby face (with teeth) and the biggest beluga gets up to 18 feet. These people saw an animal in the water and didn't care what it was, they started shooting. By the time they did identify the animal as a baleen whale, it had been tortured for 90 minutes and was already bleeding to death. Again, I believe that these people poached an internationally protected species and that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",

Our budget is $4.3b, we have $1.3b, we need $3b. Any state consumption or state income tax would only bring in $500m each. After wrestling with the issue (among great minds I might add) the class attendees decided the only option that solves the budget crisis would be to use the dividend payout (earnings, not principle - yes your PFD) OR restructure the oil tax formula to pre 2012. Did you know our ever brilliant legislators changed the way AK is paid oil taxes from GROSS to NET profit?! And worse case scenario was $40/barrel?! One economist teaching the class speculated if the oil taxes were still paid on gross, we'd have $4b in oil tax revenue (based on actual barrel market prices) in the bank. As Robin Brena has recommended, I say we restructure back to GROSS and have a fair tax structure sans legislator favors!",

You can't avoid it with backroads either - they are jammed too.\n\nWhat changed ? The trains stopped running reliably. We can debate why but the core of it remains: when the trains worked reasonably well, many people (including lots of white-collar workers) used them to get to work. Now all those people are using taxis or cars - and the roads simply cannot handle the extra load. We need MPT to make cars feasible.",

Prisons don't discourage others from committing crimes they provide employment for thousands of men and women who might well be happier elsewhere if the opportunity was provided.

Sometime after 6-months of doing our regular reporting routines, and writing our parts, it was time for publication. My part is called; \"Where is the Leadership?\" The series won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988. In a paragraph, that is the quick story on that. I have on my desk today, a Pulitzer Prize Medallion for my small part.

Stopping hunting and trapping of Wolves is the surest way to see the prey increase so that we can see the Wolves increase naturally. What is so hard to understand here? If more Wolves are desired there has to be food, protection with expanding buffer areas does nothing except pit extreme sides against each other. Those of us that like the park and to hunt and understand trapping see this for what it is.

In 1984, the Joint Declaration was signed because of a quirk in history - the fact that Hong Kong island was, in perpetuity, owned by Britain but the Kowloon Peninsula was leased from the Chinese for 99 years, and therefore, by the nature of leases, either extended by the owner (in this case, China), or the property reverts back to China. \nChina was in no mood to have the lease extended...so therefore there needed to be a orderly transfer of control, eventually of the entire colony (because no one believed that a Hong Kong island split from Kowloon made any sense).  The Republic of China on Taiwan seeing all of this never really bought Deng Xiaoping's idea of one country two systems to be implemented on Taiwan. So to this day, the ROC on Taiwan rejects the idea wholeheartedly. \nAs so it is to this day. China can rule Hong Kong with a velvet glove, the ROC aint buying it.",

The lesson not learned from history is how the industrialist (yes capitalists) made huge fortunes from getting rid of big numbers of 'workers' and pocketing most of the money saved. It is being repeated but in much bigger terms now with the IT industry. Check out how wealthy are the owners of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter etc etc while huge numbers get thrown to the wolves. AJ as a professed caring socialist how can you take 100% the side of the wealthy that are changing the world, my view mostly for the good but making billions. They avoid being critted by donating to the Dems and saying the right things, all the while forcing bad employment practices in their firms and associated supplier companies.

Youth who have left to join the NONES have repeatedly informed both churches that they have left due to sexism, and clericalism, and poor treatment of LGBT, and our rather unchristian behavior over all.  So even though there have been married priests in the Orthodox churches, they too are dissolving, under the strain of continued sexist hatred, clericalism, and religion that is becoming increasingly unchristian over time.  We can't fault the NONES for noticing bad behavior and injustice and then leaving.  However, Jesus can fault us for supporting that example which caused him to lose his flocks.",

Tradition typically dictates that in the event of a tie the speaker vote for the continuation of debate (if it's not a final passage) or for the status quo.

Services employment was flat as a jump in education services, likely reflecting shifting hiring patterns for teachers, was offset by a pullback in culture and recreation employment.\n- From RBC's Daily Economic Update",

Under the independent counsel statute that expired in 1999, Congress could formally request the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor (see role of legislative and judicial branches); however the law only required the attorney general to respond in writing with a decision and reasons, and in any event it is no longer in force.[18] Similarly, under the statute, the choice of who to appoint as special prosecutor was made by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals.

However, as we all know every rule has its exception.  In this case, over time we have seen where the one exception for our Gov., has been that where Children are involved.  Now fast forward to DACA.  We have arrived with DACA where this Administration is turning its back on 'Children' (more like spitting on them really).  This great country of ours is a democracy and of course, the will of the majority shall prevail. but in this case is that a good thing.  Sadly, I see it as one more reason why we are in a decline as a nation and if our goal is to really once again make this country great again then we can't do it by dumping on the greatest resource of our nation (of any nation) which is our children!

What it cannot anticipate is a labor strike, for example, or a law suit that shuts down the project, sometimes for years.   \n\nHART has been subjected to  a lawsuit that shut it down for a year that severely impacted the cost of construction.

A search for a needle in a haystack, perhaps?  We need to look for other sources of support for reconsidering a doctrinal legacy which, sadly, has very little support at the present time.

No party has proposed a meaningful way forward for this part of the economy and the people who dependent on it. There is a second part of the economy based on design, technology and innovation that is growing rapidly but is largely urban. This is also poorly understood but is currently thriving.
