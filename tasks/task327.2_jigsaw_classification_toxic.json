Now in May, CPI-common Is still only at 1.3%, while the CPIX inflation rate has sunk like a stone, to 1.3% in March, 1.1% in April and 0.9% in May. It seemed to be a decision whose only rationale was to lower the headline core inflation, and it seems that the Bank failed even in achieving that objective.",

According to Renuka Chowdhury, Women and Child Development Minister six years go, more than half the children in India are subjected to sexual abuse, but most do not report it. Parents and relatives were mostly found to be the perpetrators of child abuse, too. And only in the last ten years has the government started to bar (against parents' wishes) the employment of children under age 14 as domestic servants or in hotels, restaurants or small tea shops because they are often subjected to sexual abuse, violence and mental trauma. Given this reality, one would think bishops would be all the more proactive in keeping the church safe from such savage and pitiless exploitation of children.",

Let's recap, to date there is no scientific facts supporting the view that the mine would endanger the fisheries. In fact, an EPA paid for and sanctioned peer review found this to be the case see here: http://www.nationalcenter.org/NPA646.html  .Indeed, this is why the EPA recently settled out of court - there was no scientific basis for the decision.\n\nWhat has occurred, is a great deal of fear mongering and hyperbole, not based on fact but politics. Let's let sound science lead to the decision not prejudging and bias based on personal agendas. Alaska needs jobs and is in a serious fiscal quagmire - its time for Alaskans to stop playing politics and use facts.",

Some companies will have the pricing power to pass the whole tax on to the consumer, some will only pass on part of it, and some will not pass any of it on for a while.  But it will raise the company's operating costs and therefore at some point, the price for the product will increase unless demand falls or competition causes a price reduction(s) .\n\nAt least with a sales tax it is transparent, one knows they are paying it, and can consciously decide if he or she wants to pay it.

Because ordaining married people in our church before we are ordaining women priests means we are literally creating Segregation by Gender.   This makes our religion one in which one sex has complete authority & sacramental power over the other.  This is not true in Presbyterian & other religions that have married clergy because they already ordain women priests & ministers.  \n\nWe must, in order not to create a graver sin against women's humanity than we have, take a stand to not ordain married men, as a matter of human justice, until we are ordaining women priests too.

As I've often noted, Mr. Trump demonstrates all the characteristics of a sociopath and, believe me, compromise and \"working together\" have no role in a sociopath's life.

The projects that I worked with on this topic had the primary research goal of understanding the growth of \"Nones\" and \"Dones,\" the large number of Americans who report that their religious preference is \"None\" and that they are \"done\" with organized religion. The simplistic cliches of \"church people\" has come up as one of the major reasons for this trend, but this item is blamed on laity, not clergy.

The audit complains of “inadequate planning, weak oversight, and lax contract management.”\n\nParsons Brinckerhoff worked on the Tren Urbano rail project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was projected to cost $1 billion and enjoy high ridership. Instead, it sustained a 113% cost overrun and had actual ridership only 27% of the original forecast for 2010. A new 5.5% tax was enacted partly because of unforeseen rail costs.\n\nContinue below",

Nearly all economists, of all political persuasions, agree that immigrants — those here legally or not — benefit the overall economy. “That is not controversial,” Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told me. \"  \" Stephen Goss, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration, told me that undocumented workers contribute about $15 billion a year to Social Security through payroll taxes. They only take out $1 billion (very few undocumented workers are eligible to receive benefits). Over the years, undocumented workers have contributed up to $300 billion, or nearly 10 percent, of the $2.7 trillion Social Security Trust Fund.\"\n\nRead the article....it's a good look at the whole picture",

Today, it will make no difference who acts first.  The die was cast in Korea more than two decades ago when the civilized world believed yet again manifest evil could be negotiated away.

He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

I do believe that wider education, women's getting the vote, the invention of contraceptives, two devastating world wars -  were groundbreaking events that led to an absolute need for a new vision of our Catholic faith and how it operates in our lives. Now, massive changes in communication technologies have added another layer to the fact you cannot go back.\n \nRetrenchment was the last thing the Church needed to do and it is what JPII and BXVI tried to do.

Even when he was arguing for voluntary colonization during his first two years as president, Lincoln did not envision forced deportations of ex-slaves. Moreover, historians agree that the idea of large-scale, voluntary colonization was effectively dead by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on Jan. 1, 1863 -- more than two years before Lincoln’s assassination.

Once the antler has grown and hardened, the velvet is shed in late summer, which is what is happening in this photo.  The animal will then shed the entire antler in early winter (for male caribou) or early spring (for female caribou).  A new antler will then start growing in the spring.  All antlered animals including deer, moose, elk and caribou have this (although caribou/reindeer is the only species where females have antlers - the rest only males have them).  Antler growth and shedding is regulated by the natural cycling of sex hormones, so it isn't really anything more disturbing than a menstrual cycle.",

You cannot just arbitrarily pick a given year and then claim that a law passed shortly thereafter is responsible for following changes. In most of the West the high point for violent crime was the mid-90s, and rates have been trending down ever since. To show a given law had a causal effect you have to show that the rate of decline after that law went into effect made a statistically significant change from the prior trend, and, if the \"solution\" was a gun access law, that the change persisted.\n\nMy whole point is that laws have essentially no documentable effect when you look at the data short or long term. What matters are cultural and demographic factors. The reason you push back before the first significant gun control laws is to see how \"violent\" a country was when there were no gun controls at all. That gives you a cultural baseline.",

The idea is to make the defense commit to defending the QB on every down even when he does not run, leaving others more open for big plays, but doing it with the minimum exposure to the only irreplaceable player on the team. Running him at the goal line does not qualify. Taggart is certainly the professional here, but his call was still boneheaded. He is young and will learn.

If that kid ever gets her hands on any of the reward her mother won't be able to stop her incredibly terrible choices. There is another tradegy setting up. Innocent lives with the likes of Gin's immaturity are coming into play. When it goes bad, it'll be really, really awful. \n\nIf you go to Erick Almandinger's Facebook and select friends you see Gin Berry's.

Police cameras may not be a perfect tool for assessing officer conduct (or misconduct),  but they are a big step up from simply accepting a police officers assertion that \"I felt threatened\" as a definitive answer to any and all police use of force with out any further follow-up or accountability.  I agree with the assertion that measures need to be taken to increase perceptions of \"police legitimacy\".  An officer simply screaming at an unarmed and non-threatening citizen to \"comply\" before tazing or shooting them seems to be the direction that police training has been going - and it is guaranteed NOT to de-escalate situations or foster feelings of legitimacy among citizens who encounter it.  We need a shift in how police are trained, and to get there we need to SEE what isn't working.",

If that Court, the Catalonian High Court in this case declares it illegal the police and state are required to act. Or is that not how things work in the real world where rule of law applies. The Catalan Yes side were completely aware of this, since the former Catalan leader who held the last referendum is currently in court facing charges for doing this very thing, after yet another court decision ruling against it. It was for this reason many village blockaded their voting stations the night before, they were fully aware of the legal status. This is why refused to allow the police to carry out their task, which then required their removal. This is not a democratic process, by excluding all others in the country, by excluding Catalans themselves who are not in Catalonia this cannot be called Democratic, this is pure Ethnic Nationalism and the result engineered by those exclusions.",

I also believe it would be fair and legal to put a moratorium on travel from ALL countries of the world as a matter of policy (just not some).  I think, however, that banning travel from all countries would have catastrophic economic effects on the US, and a ban on travel by Japan nationals and Chinese nationals in particular would devestate Hawaii economically (could there be a pretext for banning a country from which Hawaii enjoys high tourism numbers?  Yes.  That is what,  I think motivates Chin's efforts, in part).

Appeals will always be exceedingly costly and any defendant that uses their full allotment of appeals for any conviction can run up a staggering bill.

In fact, Ms. Kobliner's description of a teary 10 year old needing to be told that his birthday gift of an ipad cost what several less expensive items might have, gives voice to the idea that lots of good can come from children understanding the full value of a request, before they make it. Ask yourself if you would prefer to be surprise and disappoint your kids, or prepare and delight them when their birthday or another gift-giving opportunity presents itself.

No way that should have been caught without them.  Now putting that aside,  naming Brady for a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach is a thing of beauty.  Brady's hiss takes 3 forms:  a disturbance hiss which is applicable to Brady cus he is old and only older Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches can do that;  a female attracting hiss which I will not talk about at this time;  and the aggressive fighting hiss, which only Brady can qualify for that (a few years ago he made 2 TDs in the last minute of a game.)  Thus the zoo equating a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach with the Patriot QB is one of the greatest compliments of all time for Brady.   Remarkable!  But I still say that Edelman's catch was a freak of nature.  Then again with the Hissing Cockroach;  his fighting quality may have meant that if the catch was dropped he still may have pulled off a win.",

God forbid, your kid gets someone else's kid sick or passes lice but other parents then blame the child and the child's parents for deliberately allowing their child to be around their kids. Most people understand children get sick or pass germs or are carriers. Most people immediately alert other people if their child is sick or contagious so people can be aware.

Now gays, as you admit, make up 4% of the human race, far dwarfing the number of Jews. So the persecution of gays has taken in absolute terms a greater toll (augmented by the absence of a gay community analogous to the Jewish community). It is true that the Nazis focused their paroxysm of hatred on the Jews, a group who had been denounced as deicides in church teaching, condemned to Hell at the Council of Florence, and seens a justly condemned to perpetual servitude by Paul IV in 1555 (Bull, Cum Nimis Absurdum, ratified by popes in later centuries).

It's not that Lynch was a first round pick per se, it's that he was a 1st round pick for a reason - his physical attributes are better, his college experience is better, his potential is better.  \n\nDoes that mean he'll automatically be better in real NFL games?... No. Many high draft picks still miss. It just means there's a much better chance he will be good. \n\nRoughly one UDFA QB per decade turns out to be a very good NFL QB.  Maybe Sloter is the one.

The first casualty of battle is the plan. And so we try to be open to the Spirit as we move along. The Spirit is walking point. \n\nBasta cosi.",

He is likely to fire Mueller and to pardon anyone who can hurt him -- including himself.\nThe fact that POTUS is crazy is not grounds to impeach, and the process for removing him because he's crazy is beyond cumbersome. He must be impeached for his crimes, which is itself a tough process. But the Congress must get on with it; I think they are already laying the groundwork. It would be malfeasance if they aren't.",

It is also extremely energy efficient.  Ultimately, the impacts of the rail on traffic reduction and CO2 emissions will depend on how many people ride the rail system, the greater the umber of riders, the greater the reduction in both congestion and CO2 emissions. The FEIS did not show a net reduction in traffic congestion with rail in 2030 over 2007's traffic because 1) it projected a total increase of daily trips island wide of about 25% (from 3.2 to 4 million) due to resident and visitor population growth, and 2) because of conservative mode shift estimates having only 1.4% of trips shifting from cars to transit.  The ridership projections in the FEIS were conservative and based solely on the addition of the rail, and excluded all other policies that can impact mode choice.",

It is that risk that prompts so many of us to urge all people choosing to use our amazing trail systems to be vigilant, attentive to surroundings, and alert.

Here's another thing I know for certain:  There is not a pair of shoes on the planet that First Lady Melania could wear without being vilified in foul language by the Dem/Lib/Left.   Meanwhile, the wife of a cigar-smoking impeached POTUS continues to whine, whine, whine.  Dems and their ilk just keep going lower and lower.",

Motley's theory is that Trump and his staff have planned this all along and is part of a long term strategy to make the other side look stupid. If Motley's theory is true, they just got a bloody nose. Keep it up and get a black eye.  Keep on going and pretty soon \"they\" just lose credibility on all subjects.\n\nI didn't vote for Trump, nor a fan, and not a republican. But he is my president and I want to support him on issues I agree with and fight him on those I disagree with.  But I want to do it on the high ground; not some rabid, frothing at the mouth, the world is coming to an end, partisan propaganda BS.\n\nP. S.

The white man has tried to assimilate the rural Alaskan Natives by imposing the White man's culture and education on them.

This is the foundation for White men assuming their culture is better and the cash economy is the only method of survival.

Cable chains are lightweight, easy to put on, and will allow you to drive at 50km/hr on snow covered roads.  Carry the chains in the trunk along with a pair of winter gloves and a piece of plastic to lie on.  Practice putting the chains on in your driveway before you leave.  Get them as tight as possible and then tighten them again after a km or two.  Having a couple of bungee cords to stretch across the face of the wheel to pull the cables tight helps also.

I take it that you are either misinformed or ignoring the clues in your responses here about the fact that these four men are running as (1) a slate, and (2) as Republicans financed and supported by the Republican Party. To their credit,  the three women candidates don't hide their affiliation and don't deny it when noted.  A little transparency would be refreshing from folks who use that as a bludgen when they disagree with something, but I understand the reasons for not wanting to be identified to the general public as a Republican.",

Yes, Halifax and Nova Scotia need more well-paying jobs, but these numbers would overwhelm the region to the detriment of livability, to say nothing of cost of living or infrastructure. What holds the province back is more the parochial attitudes of its politicians, not to mention things like Savage's laughable comparisons to Seattle. Halifax is about 400,000 people generously spread around the peninsula, Dartmouth and suburbs around the basin, situated in a province with less than a million people. Seattle may have only 700,000 in the city proper, but the metro region has closer to 4 million. It's bigger than Vancouver and closer to Montreal in size.",

Muslim lifestyle makes them tough - prayers, meditation, fasting, better able to answer to the Primal Question of Existence - Survival, Growth, Evolution.\n\nThe Corporate Capitalist West is repeating the same mistakes Muslims made in centuries 7-14 AD after Mohammed died - materialism, colonialism, racism, misogyny, pornography, same-sex unions. The West should learn from debacle of that Islam to reform itself.",

A prime example is the posters on this forum who denigrate the PM by referring to him as Justine. The reason men haven't been drawn in large numbers to those careers is because they were viewed negatively as \"women's work\" and historically the women in those jobs were paid less. Now those jobs are being better compensated and surprise surprise you are starting to see an increase in men in those roles. It takes time however for societal expectations to change. The more we move away from stereotyping roles for men and women the less you will see gender imbalances in the workforce.",

Rather they show \"that for each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child well-being, outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries, whether rich or poor.\" (Wiki). \n\nAs a country do we want more wealth or better living conditions? What I  found truly amazing is that Japan, an economic basket case, is tied with Sweden as the best place to live, based on the above factors. There is correlation between living conditions and income inequality across 23 developed countries. No explanation, just data. Solid.  .",

I knew about the possible side effects (they're written on the bottle), but Meflaquine was the only anti-malarial that is effective against cerebral malaria, which was rampant where I was living.\n\nMalaria is incredibly pervasive and deadly - over a million people die of it every year. The potential side effects are worth the risk.\n\nAs for Canadian soldiers, my take is that Meflaquine was used as an excuse for egregious behavior in Somalia, and the urban myth has dragged on.",

There were then attempts to present a facade of cooperation in governance between the victorious forces.  Mugabe was and is a militant marxist and he began to seize power, bringing the new Zimbabwe into the soviet bloc.

As a mental health practitioner I think the article you cite fails to mention that in teenagers, the executive centers of the brain are not fully functional and won't be until the mid twenties.

We can see this historically for millennia and recently with even younger children in the developing world.  We really need to understand that teenage brains are not yet adult brains and decisions we think teens should be capable of making aren't a given.  \n\nI will most certainly watch this series to make up my own mind, but the fact it's been produced is a positive thing....whether that makes us comfortable or not.",
