    "Definition": "the type of \"yes, and\" is indicated by the two responses. if the first response is correct, indicate the response by'response 1'. \"yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb that suggests that the participant in the dialogue should accept what the other participant has said (\"Yes\") and then expand on that point. in short, the \"yes, and\" is a dialogue exchange in which the speaker adds new information to the information / setting that was created by another speaker. in fact, if the dialogue is not explicitly agreed to by the participant, it may be possible to say \"Yes, and.\" without explicitly saying \"Yes, and.\". the response could be implicitly or explicitly agreed to the prompt without explicitly saying \"yes, and.\"",
