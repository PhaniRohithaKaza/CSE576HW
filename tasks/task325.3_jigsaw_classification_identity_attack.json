Non-treaty based annexation of another State is not an enumerated power nor does it seem to be a \"necessary and proper\" power. Congress doesn't possess the authority to annex.. \"This government is acknowledged by all, to be one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, would seem too apparent, to have required to be enforced by all those arguments, which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, found it necessary to urge; that principle is now universally admitted.

There is a huge backlog for even getting in to start the classes, so right off the bat the chances of him paroling at 9 years are low. \n\nOn top of that, in order to complete treatment, he will have to acknowledge that he is guilty and take responsibility for his actions (and probably his prior actions, the Hawaii high school thing will probably come back up). Sounds like he's not ready to do that, so treatment's not going to go well.

Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.\n\nI think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum",

For some women, it might be sexually aggressive.\nThis sort of stuff is in the eyes of the beholder, and that is what I behold.

All this silence really means is that nothing has changed.

A good example of another failed project was when they hired the architect to design the UH softball stadium. The architect, who had never designed one before, designed a stadium where most of the seats had an obstructed view of the field. It was so bad they had to lift the entire field 1-2 feet to correct the problem.

There are 1.6 billion mostly peaceful Muslims, and that includes the vast majority of Muslims in warring states. ISIL burned a pilot.

But the NRA has bought the 2nd amendment and will fight tooth and nail to maintain the inflow of money and influence that they enjoy.  The simple difference between Canada and the US is that owning a gun in a privilege which can be removed by law.  In the US there is a right to bear arms that gun-owners beleive is untouchable, which has been narrowed from a militia to individuals.

Trump's vulgarity disgusted me to the point that I couldn't vote for him despite agreeing with his policies more than Clinton's.

Specifically, claiming that pro-life women have no place at the march and that they do not want their support.  Abortion hurts women first and foremost since every baby killed, half of whom are girls, also has a mother who felt that abortion was their only option and must live with the aftermath.  There is also the issue that the media coverage of this event will, beyond a shadow of a doubt, be far less coverage than what they will give to the far larger march on Washington that will occur next Friday.",

But only real data can speak to this matter and such data is suppressed by the criminal justice industry in support of the status quo.  Fear is a powerful tool of manipulation and suggesting that the dude must be incarcerated because he is dangerous convinces many without evidence.  I think that a drastically shorter sentence would be effective in discouraging crime.  Say 5 years.  Putting a man in a cage for 5 years is really just torture, so we could also just torture him at the outset.  Make it impossible for him to shoot by cutting off his hands.

Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism. Also, the function of marriage between one man and one woman. That is why the homosexual act is scandalous, but isn't the worst of them.",

Or how about the concept that whites should pay reparations from something that happened centuries ago.  I’ve never heard the demand of reparations from those who sold their ancestors into slavery. But here is a new thought – the writer of the article should look at why “whites” rank “better” than others.  Example – why do more whites own their homes?  I do believe racism exists and does impact people of all races.  But there is also a lot of personal responsibility – such as education, finding a job, etc.",

And Facebook is totally there for you!\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that.

I thought that westerners lacked cultural understanding of Islam.  However after many recent years of Islamic terrorists murdering thousands of innocent people I no longer support Islam.  Islamic terrorism is a daily event (Russia is soup-de-jour today, I believe).  There are many countries with large Muslim minorities like France (how has that been working for you lately?).  There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.   I think that Islam is a stupid and barbaric religion forever frozen in 7th century violence.  If I said this in a Muslim country I would be murdered.  If I said this in a European country my life would be in danger.  I believe that in Canada I can still safely say what I think,.... but for how long?",

Not the same thing.\nSo then O'Reilly comes out with an interview with a guest booked to support Trump's error that turns out to be not who he claimed to be. O'Reilly said of his guest: \"Mr. Bildt does consulting work on terrorism, that is true, but we should have clarified that he had no direct role with the Swedish government...a more relevant guest should have been used on the anti-immigrant side.”\nWhen a reporter wrongly said the bust of King was removed from the White House, he apologized. In response to this apology, KellyAnn Conway dismissed the clarification, noting the story is \"already out there\".  Will we see O'Reilly's comment on Breitbart?

It's pretty obvious that they more than make up their loss in PFD from more per Diem money, so in essence, legislators don't have to take any cut at all and they darn sure won't tax themselves or re oganize our government to be more efficient.",

In fact they are only allowed to do ONE THING and one thing only:  hire and fire the CEO of HART.  That's it.  And they just pushed Grabauskas into quitting by getting ready to fire him.  The question you really need to ask yourself (and your boss at the Djou campaign) is WHY WOULD A REPUBLICAN PUSH TO CREATE A NEW, EXPENSIVE SUPER-BUREAUCRACY? What kind of 'fiscal conservative' would give a blank check to this bureaucracy with no oversight from the elected officials who COULD have been held accountable if rail was still managed at City Hall??

The liberal people I know feed, clothe, and even foot bathe the homeless, they see them as people and want to help. Unfortunately, it means downtown businesses and people who would otherwise enjoy the downtown areas that are infested with loud, mentally ill, drugged out and obnoxious transients, cannot walk down the street without getting abused. I have compassion for folks who are homeless by a bad break, the ones who are doing whatever they can to build better lives. The others, not so much.

What they do with it exceeds the role that EGW counseled for the GC and for keeping decisions at the Conference and Union levels. We've even added Divisions to the hierarchy since her time. That's too much administration and, hence, too much administrative expense. \n\nUnfortunately, Adventist ministry runs on the value that promotion means a move into administration, so that trimming our bloated system is even more of an uphill fight.\n\n http://atoday.org/budget-shortfall-20-percent-among-challenges-faced-gc-committee-meeting/",

We never needed the oil/tar sand development. \nIt is just like a human being doesn't need crack cocaine  But once you are hooked on it, it ravages life. The *oil sands* are not economically feasible. A barrel of oil must be selling at about 75 bucks before oil produced from the sands turns a profit and provides jobs. Futhermore it produces the worst sorts of poisons, through rivers in the area and for hundreds of miles. When the Saudi's decide to shut the oil sands down, all they do is open a tap and increase volume on the market. Boom baby.  A barrel of oil is suddenly 40 bucks. The oils sands is a disaster that one day soon, will be a ruin of abandoned sites...and then what does Alberta do to clean up the vomit left behind  by oil corporations.",

By definition, there can only be ONE \"one universal god\".\n\n\"Sikhs dislike the very IDEA of eternal damnation\"\nGood for them. I find the idea horrid and repulsive. It's against any concept of a just or merciful god, but it gives the people who believe that idea (who always seem to think they will never end up in that status) license to be condescending and worse towards people they don't like.\n\nAgain, thank you for your comment",

Unless you have in mind an infinitely fire-impervious door (that doesn't exist) akin to a \"bulletproof\" vest, I fail to understand your confusion.  Actual standards for fire doors vary but it would not surprise me that even a building constructed in the 1970s incorporated fire resistant doors in its specifications.\n\nIf you remain confused, I suppose you could look up the original contractor's specifications for the Marco Polo.  Or, failing that, you could take a moment to google what the definition of a \"fire door\" is.",

Low income renters, with lower education, lesser skill sets, lack of financial power make any negotiation with major corporations a mismatch. \n\nGovernment representing the interest of the poor is not  universally accepted.   For some it is an unfair bias contrary to their personal interest.

A couple of years later, he didn't remove his battery when he sat down and I asked why.  He told me that the CIA was now installing secret batteries to record even when the regular battery was removed.\n\nHe also told me that the cell phone companies were complicit in this spying, as they did not identify nor charge for the downloaded data usage.\n\nThat was 15 years ago.",

The costly reconfiguration of streets, repetitive SEPA applications and city employee time expended on this project are far to costly.  Whoever the city paid to site MICA in a park, in a wetland area with zero parking should give the money back.  That was probably another collaboration between MICA and the City.",

Given Buds' defence, its forwards have to come out with a much smarter and  grittier effort right from the first bell.  You can't neutralize and  expect the game to go your way if all you want to do is watch and dance around a little with the puck.  You have to play the whole game, from your head to your toes,  and  keep the elements of  grit and desire at the upper levels of your effort.  Unfortunately, at this time of the season, everyone who wants to stay in the run, plays tougher hockey; the greater lesson these kids must learn is that: to address their goals, they must play hard, at both ends of the rink.

This means it was left to the voters and they had to hold their collective nose and pull the lever for Trump.\nHad the Democrats presented a decent human as their candidate, that person would be in office today.  Instead we somehow got the two most disliked people possible and the third party candidates were never serious options.  \nBeyond that, moving to today, the damage done by invalidating a Constitutionally elected president would be much worse.  The best you could hope for would be Mike Pence as president, but the protesters we will see on 4 November are completely opposed to that, though it is Constitutionally mandated if Trump is out.

My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming.

Once their common enemy is cleansed, they will turn on each other.\nTurkey is not a true friend of the US or its NATO partners so if the US has to lose the use of their airbases, so be it.  Not only have the Turks historically been supressing the Kurds and Christians but they were also responsible\nfor the mass genocide of the Armenians who were largely Christian.  The word and meaning of genocide came from the mass slaughter of the Armenians by the Turks who have never been willing to admit what they did to Armenian people despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.",

If women actually are seen as representing God then men are really not 'separate but more equal', which is what their identity has largely been built on. They are actually then 'less equal' in their own eyes because they can't give birth. That's one reason they push the strange analogy that 'women can't be priests like men can't give birth', which really makes no sense at all.",

Helfrich's maxed out at $3.85 million in 2019. Both coaches held the job for four years; both coached in and lost national-title games. Both won a Rose Bowl.\n\nHelfrich, who made $2 million during the 2014 title run, was a bargain by comparison. No one complained about Kelly's compensation. Winning mutes that.\n\nAlso, Helfrich is obligated contractually to mitigate the buyout liquidation by making a reasonable effort to seek comparable employment. If he finds another job paying half as much, Oregon is on the hook for the other half. His contract is readily available online for perusal.",

Since then, the \"rules have changed,\" so we need a simple ballot question:  Do you wish to have rail construction continue until Ala Moana Shopping Center even if it means the total price and timeline are unknown, the current half percent excise tax increase could possibly remain indefinitely, and that property taxes may be increased to fund it?

The constitutional budget reserve was put in place for the very reason it is being used for.  To cover a deficit on a rainy year.  You can look back as little as 8 years ago to see the CBR value was only $2 billion.  Nobody was pining seriously for the dividend yet then.  And then oil prices went up, and so did our savings.  So to say the CBR cannot be replaced - that's what i call fear-mongering.  At today's prices it will not be replaced.  \n\nThe PFD is not paid out of the state budget or the CBR.  It is paid from the earnings on investments received by the prinicipal in the permanent fund.  It is completely sustainable without ANY oil contributions, albeit at a lower payout.  Which is why the government wants access to it.\n\nIt is, at this time, completely unnecessary to impact the people of the state except to make them more receptive to taxes and other income sources when this does become an issue.",

The TO housing inventory started to shrink over the last decade and once the double land transfer was imposed the number of detached homes that were listed grew even smaller.  People have pretty much stopped moving as it is too expensive to move.  Foreign buyers are making the situation worse as they are coming in by the droves.\nThe gov't has to impose huge taxes on foreigner investors who are passing through our country ( as this article suggests) as they are not true immigrants and they are not supporting our society in any way shape or form.  Canadians have to come first !",

We hired West Constructors to review the work and to demonstrate proper sheet pile installation.  Their conclusion was that a significant portion of the work, done under the Begich administration, would have to be torn out.  We also conducted an independent review of the geoseismic suitability of the design and the conclusion was it was insufficient.  We downsized the scope of the project, re-designed it and successfully obtained $100 million from the state to keep the project moving forward.   We filed lawsuits against all the parties involved, including MARAD, who were the project managers, not Governor Sheffield.  MARAD failed in all aspects of their responsibilities.",

Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?

It’s not a doctrinal issue. It has nothing to do with abuse and everything to do with Trad prejudice. The generation that insisted on that prejudice is dying out. Those of us who were not bold enough to resist are not far behind them but the younger adult generations will force change, not by voting with their feet but with their contribution envelopes.

Im not saying who is better but the hype is huge on both ends of the dial.  TSN is over the top during their broadcasts but they are pandering to a Leafs audience.  Ive watched Habs games and wanted to hurl based on their banter about how great every 3rd line grinder is but thats the nature of the beast for every market.  TO is not unique, its just bigger than most.\n\nIts great that our two teams have such a good player from the draft this year...in fact the Jets are quickly becoming my 2nd favorite team.",

They knew the militia was the mechanic down the road, the college student attending school full time, the nanny,the house wife and so on. So in order for a militia to form in time for action or on the spot these people needed to have their weapons at the ready. Other wise they could not have cut the British off at Lexington and Concord. They learned from the war that the people needed to be armed and so the Founders ensured we had that right in the Bill of Rights. Also note they put the stated the Second that way, Because King George could enter your home with out warrant and confiscate any weapon, it was one of many grievances we had with the British.",

In that philosophy – as far as I can interpret it – everything is made up of a 'substance' (which seems to be a conceptual category) and 'accidents' which are the sensory appearances.\n\nFrankly, the whole philosophy does not make much sense to me.\n\nAccording to it, the 'Conceptual Category' (substance) changes during Eucharist, so that we say both bread and wine are now the presence of the Risen, glorified, sacrificed Jesus - whole and entire, body and blood soul and divinity – as the Church expresses it.\n\nThough sensory realities remain the same – it looks and tastes like like bread, our Faith concept is that it is Jesus present. Thus 'trans-substance'! but not trans-accidents'.",

The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.  As Chief Justice Roger B. Taney said in the famous 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision about the Founding Fathers’ mindset in drafting the Constitution:\n\nBlacks had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.

I'm in fundamental disagreement with them on that, and you can either agree with me or not that that's a valid position to hold. The fact remains that I hold it on a number of issues. So, to answer your question, the applicability of church teaching is not as important to me as the demands of my own conscience. I think the church always wants to make official teaching neat and clean on issues that are inherently messy. I believe that sometimes it's better to learn to live with paradox than avoid it.

Since the church still officially teaches that being gay is \"objectively disordered\" and \"intrinsically evil,\" thereby intentionally instilling shame in those so \"afflicted,\" few priests will ever admit to being gay if they still want to collect a paycheck, which the vast majority need to do in order to survive in this cold, cruel world. Even on National Coming Out Day (whenever that is) such a mass exodus from the priestly closet is highly unlikely. Now if the church were ever to change its tune in terms of doctrinal teaching then I suspect such an exodus is more likely, though it would probably begin more as a trickle  than a deluge.",

Run counters and dump passes are more effective in keeping the league's defences honest, than over passing into the flats, which take too long and are subject to easy interceptions. The OL must advance, not drop back, unless its for a long pass.  To me, he seemed uncertain and confused and it wasn't all due to the Lion's counters at him.",

Thats less than 10% of our 350 million population so a 10% insurance tax would more than cover all.   Erase statelines and let groups and associations create their own insurance groups so all individuals can join groups.  The people needing subsidized would then register for subsidy in state pools.  Add a 10% fee/tax to everyone's insurance policy to cover them.  10% is a lot less than the double digit increase we have been seeing from Obamacare and a lot less of a percentage than the increases in Obamacare for next year.   Using only the people that are in Obamacare that are not subsidized to cover the subsidized participants is unfair as they are forced to subsidize the greatest percentage of uninsurables in the U.S.  The burden needs to shared by all.  A 10% insurance fee/tax would cover more than everyone, reduce costs for all, and its a free market solution.",

In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a \"terrorist threat\" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.",

As well as the Spirit guiding, the human element in development is very strong. Indeed the Evil One is very keen to get in on the act of development to lead us astray.\n\nGiven both of these, I would suggest that the Eucharist is preeminently sacred food as evidenced by the the manner in which it was introduced by Jesus. There are two reasons, IMHO, for today downplaying the Eucharist as an object of adoration: (1) it was introduced and served for a long time to displace frequent reception, and (2) emphatic adoration outside of mass is a uniquely Catholic practice. Eccumenism is a solid reason for down playing this practice.",

They are brainwashed as children by their Quran which demands that they lie about their intentions until they are in great  enough numbers to kill or enslave the infidels as the Quran tells them to. Mohammed their prophet was a pedophile and a mass murder. Islam does not fit my definition of religion. Does your religion ordered you to kill or enslave people not of your religion?

The 60's scoop was just a continuation of this, except this time the provinces were given jurisdiction to take the children, change the birth certificates, hide the background and make people white. So were are talking about 8 generations. This is our countries genocide, our shame. Until we understand this and stop thinking about how we are 'helping' will stay stuck.",

How do you compete against a country that has their currency devalue 50% in a year. All this happening when their economy is doing reasonably well. Well maybe you look at a cushion on currency exchanges. Meanwhile Mexico doing absolutely nothing to protect their border. I would ask Mexico to build 1/2 the wall. They can do it far cheaper than USA can and it will put folks to work. Canada and USA have very good environmental laws. Mexico has next to none. Again a huge disadvantage.\nThe list is many and the USA can't afford it anymore.",

As technology and globalization make bigotry and racism less profitable, they refuse to change with the times. On some deep level they realize that merit and equality for all are social and economic demotions for them. They would rather die than admit this truth. Sadly, like they do in their families when they commit murder suicides, they want to take the rest of us down with them if they can't have their way. Then along came Russia with their boy Trump.

Trudeau looked rather like Chicken Little when the PBO came out with its own unconstrained estimate of a $1.2B surplus for 2015-16 after the election. As it turned out, the surplus would have been larger than this, nearer to $2B dollars, if the Liberal stimulus measures had not turned it into a $1B deficit. Trudeau used this ability to use the resources of the PBO to his own partisan advantage in 2015, but now wants to change the rules to prevent the Opposition from doing the same thing against him in the 2019 election.",

Many of them have already been accomplished in and around Mt. St. Helens and Spirit Lake.\nhttp://www.icr.org/article/5465/\nhttp://www.icr.org/article/mt-st-helens-catastrophism/",

My point is that, really, it is none of my, nor your, business.  Unless you observe the activity, or if they proclaim their sexual preferences, you have no way of discriminating against the person.

Health education and preventative care by teaching was a necessity and we were often rewarded by the results of taking poor and under-educated folks and helping them having some control on what  involves caretaking of a human body. The goal was to see people before they showed up at the ER, sicker and harder to treat. The ideal then was simple, a healthy population was an asset to this nation.  In my mind because of decades of working on the frontlines with people of all ages and medical dx, I do not understand how some in this nation can talk about sick people like they were not the \"heart\" of the debate on healthcare, just numbers,   if they have no access to our healthcare system they can suffer untold pain and emotional agony or die.  I still hope that we have not become such a callous nation. And the \"healthy\", they get sick too",

Attempting to co-op NK into the community of nations would likely fail because the regime in part uses friction in foreign affairs to legitimize its existence as a totalitarian entity.  Working with China has failed  either because Beijing has  limited influence over the regime,  or its unwilling to use it.  The cost of military option would be too high  because NK could cause irreparable harm to SK, and possibly Japan, with its limited nuclear capability and this would provoke China.\n\nIn these circumstances, containment  is the path of least resistance but permits NK to eventually develop nuclear weapons that can reach the USA.   With NK's  reputation for irrational behaviour, this is not an appealing prospect.  \n\nBut the rhetoric of war only feeds NK paranoia.  \n\nOne could engage  NK in a dialogue that would open  the door to reduced isolation but the time is not ripe for this with the current POTUS.",

As I am able to converse in another language, I am able to talk to parents in their own language on a more personable level.  Most, if not all, parents expressed that they prefer to have their child(ren) in ESL. This is the general consensus among minority parents in any language.

Pretty soon, all those smug liberal idealists who claim our happy \"multicultural\" Canada has no populist anti-islam movement like in Europe will have to eat their words.

I've been told that I should be grateful for slavery because I'm an American. I suppose I should be grateful that they used rape as a profit center too. You don't want to know about how much rape, robbery, and murder is done to give you your white male privilege.",
