The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

In and of itself that does not sound altogether bad. But when you segregate the spending to benefit primarily those who do not earn for themselves and continuously increase the tax on those that do then it becomes a sort of slavery. Further, when the people who contribute nothing are permitted to vote on the spending and increases to taxes that is exacerbated. The tax cap was an attempt, failure that it was, to limit the extent of that slavery.",

At \"billing,\" they simply say it's not possible to tell you what something will cost: \"We don't know what equipment they may need, or what complications might develop.\"  So, unlike any other economic transaction, the consumer incurs unknown financial responsibility for something he doesn't understand. I had a simple outpatient procedure done at Prov.  The bill was $35,000!  I was in the building less than 2 hours!  My insurance would pay $13,000 max.  I told the Prov billing office I simply wouldn't pay the rest.  \"Oh, we write off a lot,\" she said airily.",

Private security companies, from Pinkerton's on, have formed the core of a transnational union busting industry that has grown ever more sophisticated since the head breaking days of the 19th century. During the height of pre-war labour radicalism in Ontario, the populist premier, Mitchell Hepburn, used public money to hire 400 goons known as \"Hepburn's Hussars\" to break the UAW's organizing in Oshawa.  \n\n It was the courts in Canada, not the government, that decided, amongst other things, that the employer has numerous unfair advantages in countering union organizing drives.",

The common perception is that everyone who gets a DUI is sloppy drunk--what about people who had a few beers during the game, it'd be a lot easier for them to wait to sober up than take the cab/get a car towed.

Second, the use of battery storage to solve grid shortcomings is a dirty, expensive, and bulky way to go. To fully realize the potential of renewable energy, means addressing the peak load problem - a very smart grid goes a long way to doing that, but other measures will likely be needed that work on a system wide basis.

The 2016 renewal agreement itself acknowledged that it was hiking the target rate of inflation; due to reductions in measurement bias of the CPI, it should have been lowered to 2.0%; not doing so amounted to an easing of monetary policy. The Bank of Canada is the only G20 central bank that targets an inflation indicator that includes mortgage interest costs. The CPI excluding mortgage interest costs had an inflation rate of 1.8% in April 2017. Since 2011, even this series no longer excludes all mortgage interest costs. An index that did would have an inflation rate in excess of 1.8%.",

ExxonMobil, International Shell, and BP are investing in them, so they are mainstream .\n\n\"Timber harvests are a part of the solution\", \"... the agency needs critical funding to better manage wildfires and restore the health of forests that are in poor shape.\",  and \"... focus on building relationships with local and state leaders in rural communities and finding economic opportunities that make the best use of state lands.\" these are all quotes that should make you feel better. Yes, she's not particularly pro-coal, but she owned a small farm and timberland, so relax and in the spirit of supporters of our new President, \"give her a chance.\"",

I do think there is something greatly amiss in the Christian vision of sexuality.  The view of \"the flesh\" as somehow inherently bad and the spirit as pure repudiates God made flesh in Jesus.  I do wonder how Christianity, but especially now Catholicism, came to so equate holiness with lack of sexual expression.    I am creeped out by the whole attempt to equate the relationship of marriage to that of Christ and His Church, Christ is the head and the rest of us are the body.  I think the \"magic man\" priest and tying that to celibacy are both ridiculous.  Although, what else can all male priests be but eunuchs if Christ, a male, is \"married\" to the Church????  \n\nHow did the ideas about human sexuality become so difficult for religions to deal with?",

Democrats, who dominated the South, opposed these measures. After the Civil War, Republicans passed laws that granted protections for African Americans and advanced social justice; again, Democrats largely opposed these expansions of power.\n\nSo, sometime between the 1860s and 1936, the (Democratic) party of small government became the party of big government, and the (Republican) party of big government became rhetorically committed to curbing federal power.\"\n\nThe historical fact that Democrats were pro slavery and Republicans were pro freedom is irrefutable.\n\nFree education here:  https://www.livescience.com/34241-democratic-republican-parties-switch-platforms.html",

What would beliefs and rituals look like if the first to expound and expand on the writings of MMLJ had been Asian, or Native American?  \n\nMaybe we all need a cultural relevant basis for belief and faith; and therefore many faiths in the world.

Why? Because if you scrimped and saved back then, you slowly got a bigger % of a down payment. Today the opposite is true - each year you sacrifice, you fall further behind. The math is shocking.\n\nWe too have moved. A full year of mat leave, while available, is simply not an option in some fast-moving professions. And given that a far larger % of employment is contract or temporary, this benefit doesn't exist. Salaries have continued to go nowhere for decades compared to a skyrocketing cost of living, so that problem you faced has only grown more pronounced.\n\nNone of this is to minimize the big challenges you faced.

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

Often, when family life gets difficult, it is the person who already receives the lower wage who gives up their job or goes part time (women).

The three million figure is probably high, “based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys.” But a much lower estimate of 108,000 also seems fishy, “because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.” Furthermore, “Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was 'used' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.”",

But that's exactly what happened.\n\nUnder ACES the state shared paid significant tax credits at lower oil prices and received a significant reward at high oil prices. Under SB21 the state still pays significant tax credits at low prices, but Alaska doesn’t get the increasing rates at high oil prices.\n\nHeads the oil industry wins, tails the state loses. \n\nThe purpose of repealing SB 21 is not to go back to ACES, it's to fix the inequities of the current tax scheme.",

Rather than paying the marginal tax rate on income of 30% the net tax rate on the $20K  could be as low as 10% (the difference between the lowest marginal tax rate and the next one up which should apply to the extra income Sally declares).

Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.\"  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.\n\nI've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was \"raped\" for their sexual encounters.  How do situations like this play into that \"1 in 9\"?  Just curious as there are some serious lines that could be blurred in some of the answers.",

Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997).\"\nSurveys have consistently reported that college men acknowledged forced intercourse at a rate of 5-15% and college sexual aggression at a rate of 15-25% (Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski, 1987; Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, and Tanaka, 1991).\nThe national survey of rape conducted by Koss et al. (1987) revealed that 1 in 12 college men committed acts that met the legal definition of rape, and of those men, 84% did not consider their actions to be illegal. \nYou seem to be full of it",

All this for 100 permanent jobs at Woodfibre and no revenue guarantee despite all the subsidies.

If the cellular companies have been the beneficiaries of public largesse in the build out of their networks then they should be willing to face competition with MVNOs etc and/or lower prices. Europe is an interesting counter example, though the gasoline analogy seems a bit of a stretch. If Canadian public transport networks offered a viable alternative to driving as in much of Europe you may find more support for higher prices (I don't mean Vancouver's bike lanes either).

They need to become personal.\"  Policy doesn't \"sell\", but the \"personal\" does.\n\nThe \"human interest\" angle always attracts readers on ANY platform. That's always been the case. Which is why some stories in G&M's \"unfounded\" file series, or the recent feature on the Fort Mac fire \"one year after,\" feature, lead with profiles of and stories about those involved. \n\nLong after Hillary Clinton's policy positions are forgotten, people will remember a number of \"personal\" incidents in which she snubbed or dismissed those she encountered. It is reported that Candidate Clark \"wished she had stopped to speak to Ms. Higgins.\" Oh, I bet she does!",

I question if in this day age it is worth the risk for a man to have intimate relations with the opposite sex. If i had a son I would advise him to avoid relationships and  to focus on improving himself intellectually, spiritually, financially and physically. If he had sexual  urges I would advise him to look at porn and get it out of his system and then get back to self improvement.",

This is not contageous, and cannot be called an \"epidemic\", because law abiding citizens are not at risk. What those numbers indicate is that thanks to harm reduction and other permissive policies towards drug use, BC is full of drug addicts that are now playing Russian roulette. Anyone who believes that there is a difference between someone overdosing or otherwise constantly high on hard drugs is utterly naive and have never seen a drug addict.

You are denying your own church communities the sacraments by looking past this gift in front of you.

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

As I recall the reason for the 2nd wild card to was almost force the 2 wild card teams to use their ace in the wild card playoff game so they would go into the next series at a slight disadvantage.  When there was just 1 wild card team, that team often went far into the playoffs because they often had the momentum of playing competitive games through the end of the season while division winners typically rested players after clinching and lost their mojo. Examples- Rockies 2007 got to the WS. Angels 2002 won the WS. Those are the 2 that immediately came to mind but I remember MLB being concerned that wild cards were often advancing far.",

A corporation is a 'legal' person and not an extension of the owner...they are two separate legal entities.   \n\nIs it not possible for the corporation to pay the owner as employee a DC pension and reduce corporate tax exposure as a cost of business?   Most employees pay 50% into a DC plan (with employee paying the other 50%)....in this example the corporation could pay 100%.

You managed to endure your regimen for six months, and you probably figure that now you're at a decent weight you'll be able to slack off a little and just maintain. Or maybe you're going to try to keep up the relatively boring nutritional plan, three days/wk of weights and three days/wk of running. Either way, I wish you luck. Please, please, please -- in the upcoming three years, write at least a yearly follow-up article. Anyone with sufficient will-power can hang in for six months -- that's not the test. It's what happens after that initial period of will power has been frittered away by a million day-to-day factors that tells the story. Personally, I find that any plan that loses more than 12 pounds per year is ultimately unsustainable and is setting you up for failure further down the road.",

Perhaps the funds will be directed towards building of more long term care facilities so the pressure on hospitals can be slightly reduced if they can move patients to a less costly, more suitable care facility.",

I did not say clouds overwhelm the greenhouse effect of CO2.  I said that light back scattered by the clouds does not get red shifted to the IR as ground incident radiation largely does.  CO2 blocks IR, not visible.  Ground incident radiation is trapped by the CO2 since it gets shifted to CO2's absorptive band while cloud scattered solar radiation remains visible and thus scoots right through the CO2 and back into space.",

It's similar to the trophic cascade that happens when you remove a top predator like wolves.  Look at the forest as a herd:  if you remove the means by which a system can regulate herd composition (ie: wolves targeting the old, sick, and weak), then another agent, such as disease, or other animals will step up and fill that niche, occasionally with highly visible effects.  Humans can potentially fill that disrupted niche by conducting proscribed burns and/or conducting selective thinning in an ecologically sound manner around human developed areas.",

Your quotation from John Jay (JJ) correctly asserts the exact opposite.

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy. IMHO, globally the correct figure today is minimally 50%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Reliable data is virtually impossible given the ongoing preference for the closet among priests.",

Maybe because of my history, in my own family there were lines of privacy around intimate body care that were never disturbed or questioned, so I can imagine being uncomfortable with the situation LW described.",

Think what things might have been said by supporters of slavery, Jim Crow, Native American genocide, public hangings, US concentration (internment) camps during WWII, etc.  I think you might be getting confused by the fact that people now have the internet: a very large, easy access soap box to stand on, and one that records everything.  The sheer volume of \"uncivility\" that one can witness is greater now than ever, but does that mean the ratio to US population is greater or discourse is less civil? I argue no.

You will notice very few on the other side have done that according to Cook's data. I could criticize Cook for other major failures in his poor handling of self ratings as well as failure to explicitly control for bias of raters, and more, but what is the point when he threw out two thirds of the data and drew his conclusions from only that which suited his predrawn purposes.

L Murphy who abused 200+ deaf kids.  \nListecki asked victims to come forward, promising healing, resolution, fair compensation. .\nIt took me a year to find the courage to come forward \nI stupidly took him at his word\n\nListecki knew all along there would be no healing. He ruthlessly used healing as bait, to trick as many victims as possible to come forward as this was a cheap way to eliminate us all at once\nHe then spent 5 yrs, + millions fighting us, saying not even one victim's claim was valid\nThe result, the archdiocese kept 200+ mil in cash, did not sell 1 property\n\nWe learned Dolan had secretly paid the clergy that raped us, 20k to quietly leave\nIn bankruptcy most victims got much less than the men who raped us\nWe are emotionally destroyed. \nIs this Mercy?",

Insurance companies do insure healthy people with the promise of protecting them financially and medically if they become sick.  They are betting that you will not become sick.  You are covering your health and finances in the event that you do.  Insurance companies have countless mathematical tables detailing risk for people with life style habits, pre-existing medical conditions, weight, age, marital status and everything else they think will effect the policy they sell.  They will price the policy (or not) according to that information. Young jogging females are a better risk than fat old men who smoke.  Life insurance and auto insurance work in similar ways.   Obamacare turned this upside-down. \nThe government has no pool for pre-existing conditions.  Medicare is an insurance policy paid by workers until retirement who are then forced into a government health care system.   \nI think there should be separate government subsidies.",

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

Here's the little-known reality \n… 2008. That’s right. It was only six years ago that the Supreme Court ruled (in a 5-4 decision with the conservatives in the majority, naturally) that there was a “right to bear arms” as these people insist has been true for over two centuries. And even then it isn’t nearly as expansive as these folks like to pretend.\nThere are recent conservative-majority rulings which may be threatened for reversal if a justice gets in who interprets the constitutionality based on facts not what NRA or Koch Brothers want.",

Hillary has continued with his bad reputation from the time she was a teenager. She has lied, She has been deceitful and dishonest.

This, of course, makes sense when there are limited resources. \n\nSo, while this new program may provide some additional resources to deal with low-level offenders, people should not expect that it is going to save any appreciable amount of money.

The state stepped in, thanks to immense embarrassment to them caused by Native American and supporting activists, and are closing 37 fracking waste disposal sites on the Pawnee Nation's reservation. The rez was bought by them from the Cherokees in 1866 after the U.S Government evicted the Pawnee from Nebraska. The U.S. had previously evicted the Cherokees from Georgia and caused the death of thousands on a forced march, once again took their land.  Just northeast, on the Osage reservation, 17 wells are being shut down if the Bureau of Indian Affairs can finally get its act together to protect them from the oil and gas industry.

Islam was born in a tribal society in which conflict was a given.  Hence God prescribes various rules regarding conflict.  They aren't all consistent (the work as a whole is full of confusing passages); some require tolerance and even protection of \"infidels,\" some encourage war against them.\n\n\"Sharia law\" is not found in the Koran.  The concept of a reasoned legal system based on the Quran and the Hadith arose only after Muhammed's time.\n\nIslam is unquestionably a religion \"as religions are generally understood to be.\" At least, all comparative religion scholars so regard it.

Over the years, quotas became concentrated in the hands of the few and today there are ~12,000 for a population of ~36M so each corporation is serving ~3,000 people. There are very few \"family\" farms remaining and those with quotas are, by and large, multi-million dollar businesses so the current system supports corporate profits at the expense of all Canadian families. Worse yet, the current system results in millions of litres being dumped every year in order to help maintain artificially high prices.

Checkout the deliberate scale down of the once mighty Royal Navy, same goes for the rest of their armed forces.  So we pick-up their slack, same goes for the Japanese.  So we have missions in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans; with additional missions in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Persian Gulf, and our home waters.  By the way, where is the Canadian Navy?  Submarines and air power are the Russian's main line of defense against us reinforcing NATO.  The Chinese have been increasing their military spending and capabilities for years.

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

That was because ironically, Forest moved toward reconciliation as he got older. He actually reinvented himself and began to advocate for black equality and rights. He was in many way, 19th century version of George Wallace. And Forest was slammed dunk by many of the white southerners for his efforts.

The Gnostics thought that \"the flesh\" was evil; and the Stoics thought that anything as pleasurable as sex was to be avoided, but could be justified by saying it was for procreation. These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture. It is a wholly man-made concept, stemming from the thought that sex is nasty.\n\nRD trots out the standard traditionalist twaddle in support of this.",

So how come companies can take pension contributions from employees, promise pension benefits and then just renege without any repercussions to the companies or their overpaid management?  How can they just avoid paying legally-mandated severance pay and get away with it?  Companies should be required to fully-fund their pension and severance liabilities (i.e. maintain assets equal to their liabilities and keep them separate from company assets) at all times.  As it is, if there's a shortfall in pension funding they are only required to develop a plan to get back to full funding eventually (they seldom do), and the regulators just go along with it.  As a former employee of a pension regulator, I was always amazed at this officially-sanctioned fraud.  If nothing else, pension and severance liabilities should at least be first on the list of priorities for payment upon company dissolution.",

More likely the story is a rollicking parody of the hieros gamos, the Pagan sex ritual which its detractors in the Hebrew Bible called 'prostitution,' and which was well attended, at least according to Dan Brown. That she \"continued kissing Jesus' feet from the time he entered the room,\" would indicate lots of agility on the part of the 'sinner.' It's supposed to be funny. And what are 'feet' in Hebrew tradition?? The Lukan author seems to share the negative view, calling the one doing the anointing a 'sinner.' In the traditional Pagan story of the Bride and Bridegroom, Her anointing would be done after the dying of the young Lord and result in his resuscitation?? So getting the story backwards, and calling Her a sinner, and not allowing Her to say a word of prophesy, as would be expected, is mocking, abuse, intolerance.

Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

So I say, let's build on what works, like Medicare, and recognize that healthcare is not a free-market good. Demand cannot be controlled/increased by improved productivity, new/better product, or discount pricing.  And competition for customers doesn't influence demand or supply either.  P.S. At my first job, in the men's room there was a sign over the urinals saying \"Please don't throw cigarette butts here\"...Someone had added: \"Makes 'em soggy and hard to light\"",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

That may have to wait for the ballot box or some other unforeseen occasion. I note that Mr. Trump would be replaced, if removed from office, by Mr. Pence. Calm, sane and rational? Perhaps. Homophobic, sexist and anti-science? Definitely. No amount of fantasy will save us from this truly dreadful choice.",

Throughout the year we see coverage of racers preparing for The Great Race. Advertisers utilize racers to promote everything from dog food to Iditarod raffle sales throughout the year. Racers travel to various parts of the States as celebrities. \n\nThe race has lost the feel of a group of Alaskan mushers who on their own dime were willing to endure the hardships of the challenge on their own. Today we see live coverage on almost every mile of the trek, mushers carrying cell phones, snow machiners following racers, crowds at every check point and endless advertising throughout the coverage.

Shipping is not appreciably better. The usual objections of prohibitive costs by Oil/Gas don't wash given the fast of rapidly dropping costs of  IoT technology and the surging competition promise of renewables. Alberta/Harper doubled down on Economic benefits overriding environment objections failed. Betting on that being forced through under Trump isn't going to make pipelines/shipping from the BC coast any more palatable in Canada if the Oil/Gas sector continues without guaranteeing no spills.

Understanding the ramifications and commitment required for child rearing will cause many, especially young women, to make the wise choice of delaying parenting and choosing abortion. In most developed countries women are well educated in their rights and make such decisions without major dilemmas. Waiting for the right time can help women to select better quality mates and potential co-parents for their children.",

He said,\"You promise?\"  I said it was a necessary principle to find out what I needed to know and so it was indispensable\".He said, \"ok. You'll be fine.\" I never would have dreamed that this journey would lead me to Christianity, let alone Roman Catholicism and especially not the Mass of the Ages, but that pastor knew if I set my sights on the Truth, I'd wind up on Jesus' doorstep eventually.  \n\nSeriously, AnnieO, if you let go of  biased opinions, it's the only place the road to Truth leads.

As far as definitions go, society as a whole must through elected representatives define what various actions and scenarios violate law and what consequence to apply.  As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

That inmate had some real success in doing this work, and once he gained his own freedom using the same studious methods, he joined with an existing legal project doing the same type of work for individuals wrongly convicted.  There are so many procedural errors made, so many cases of prosecutors refusing to reconsider the case in view of new evidence, and so very many cases of poor evidence gathering by police, it makes one cringe at the failures of our legal system.",
