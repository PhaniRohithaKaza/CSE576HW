The cops are  doing an investigative job and the last thing they need is antagonistic people enraged that they are ever questioned for  a crime.  In fact that behavior and 'running' usually implies guilt. Cops, in general,  do not 'murder' people.\n\n I do not  support vigilante's. The 2 good Samaritans down in Portland OR who were knifed to death on the light rail should not have intervened, but called the cops while possibly  trying to distract the 'nut' who was being  verbally abusive to a couple of Muslim women.",

He gave credibility to race baiter's like Al Sharpton by inviting him to the White House over 20 times. Our nation has come along ways , and still has a small ways to go.

It's kind of sad, really, because I feel like it is trying to separate us rather than unite us. We are all human, we are all born on a continuum of male/female; your clothes, hair, makeup, mannerisms, etc. do not make you male or female. Your DNA, hormones, gene expression, is unique for each person, but it doesn't make each person a new species. A man with long hair and makeup is not a woman, a woman with short hair and jeans is not a man. They are what they are, and that should be OK. It should be enough.

Chasing ambulances around, driving around in the big trucks pretending to be busy...gheez.  There are thousands of animals suffering out there....how about really helping out in society and earning your sunshine pay for part time jobs. Go out west and fight fires.  You wont be docked pay and the overstaffed headquarters here will be just fine.  While you are gone assisting, their part time job might become full time",

The reason given? The US doesn't want to go on record condemning the death penalty (even for an outrageous reason).  Protector of LGBT rights eh Trump?  Laughable.

They colluded with the sheriff to cover up my complaint, and the county prosecutor, Bruneau, wouldn't even talk to me. I agree with RFK, Jr., who said \"The Republicans are 90% corrupt, and the Democrats only 75% corrupt.\" I guess 15% less corrupt is better than nothing, but I wouldn't make a campaign slogan out of it.\n\nWhy do we need representatives to decide whether we should bomb other countries anyway? There was no urgency about this decision, and our own laws and treaties we've signed forbid non-defensive wars. I'm more concerned, however, that in the PDN's poll a majority thought it was a good idea to bomb Syria. So much for my faith in democracy.",

I agree that BLM and the Forest Service were not primarily created to protect wildlife habitat.

Here's a puzzle for you. Why does the Forest Service manage national grasslands when they have no forests to cut? Watershed and wildlife conservation would be my guess. All of the agencies included in the estimate of public expenses take wildlife management and habitat protection seriously, even if it isn't their main function. And even if you dropped ALL of the wildlife-related work done by the BLM and USFS, the amount of funding provided by nonhunters would still overshadow that by hunters. Stop defending Sen. Kelly.

Sales taxes can be structured so that they are seasonal, or scaleable, or exempt certain types of purchases.  So, a sales tax from April through September of 5% wherever no sales taxes exist, and 2% where sales taxes exist, and exempting food and pharmaceuticals, would still raise more than any income tax.\n\nRestructuring and/or capping the dividend fund is the most harmful thing the legislature can do.

There are hundreds of studies that back this up. Also, unvaccinated children are protected by vaccinated children only if herd immunity exists. If all parents think that their child will be protected by others and there are no others then disease spreads. Also some cannot be vaccinated. Then there is human physiology. No immunization is 100%, most are 80-90% effective. Meaning they can fail to protect 10% of the time. It raises to almost 100% protection with herd immunity.

World War II ended 72 years ago.  If remains are found and identified, it is becoming increasingly difficult or impossible to find a close living relative to accept them.  Moreover, what are called remains often times are bone fragments no larger than a fingernail which are placed in full-size caskets for transportation to relatives and burial.  The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency met its quota in 2017 by the disinterment of the USS Oklahoma‚Äôs 388 casualties from Pearl Harbor buried as ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù at Punchbowl.  What‚Äôs next to meet the quota?  Do they now go after those entombed in the USS Arizona?  How about the several hundred unknowns from WW II buried in military cemeteries in Europe?  Oh, let‚Äôs not forget the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington.   Will anything be off limits in quest of a quota?",

This is neither testimony nor evidence and there is no criminal charge. Jordaan doesn't need to respond to this legally. It is quite correct that Jordaan's only legal remedy, as matters rest, is to sue Ferguson for defamation. The statement is per se defamatory and so the onus will rest on Ferguson to prove on a balance of probability that her statement is either true, in the public interest or is protected by way of privilege. If Jordaan gives a version of consensual sex in a moment of mutual but regretted passion, and his version is as credible as Ferguson's, then Ferguson will lose.

Denver and the environs are already growing excessively. People who live here now subsidize this growth,  schools and infrastructure and water availability.  There are limited water resources. The infrastructure is already inadequate for the growth we are experiencing.  Transportation costs and needs are going through the roof and command fully half the state's transportation budget (unfairly so) and now Amazon wants tax breaks and incentives for a new corporate headquarters and therefore not pay for the growth imposed by them moving here.  It is the few that benefit from this type of corporate welfare and growth and the rest of us pay (including loss of quality of life).",

For $4 billion the whole corridor could be electrified.\n\nOntario is now talking about spending 4x to 10x that amount serving a handful of much smaller cities in Southern Ontario. Is it *really* necessary to build an entirely new rail line to reduce the Toronto-London travel time from 2 hours to 1 hour? Presumably there are similar improvements that could be made to existing train routes for a fraction of the cost.\n\nBut I can already tell that the province wants those photo-ops with hard hats and shovels.

This painful emotion can impel us to take corrective measures in order to rectify our mistakes which were committed in the past or could create a mindset of taking up a new path.

Look no further than the Yank depredations from Vicksburg to the Shenandoah to Fredericksburg to Annapolis AL to Atlanta to Charleston for evidence of that.\n\nIf Cohen and his ilk want to castigate 19th-century fascists and compare them with Nazis, then study Grant & Sherman who waged a Total War of ethnic cleansing against innocent, defenseless Southern civilians and Plains Indians, murdering tens of thousands of them.\n\nSee especially Grant's disgusting anti-Semitic Order #11 if you wish to compare War figures with Nazis.\n\nEven Lincoln said that emancipation was not his main goal.\n\nCohen is another Alinsky liar supported by the globalist MSM",

No voters have risen up to change their government run or regulated system. That might be an indication that the populations find the quality of service and cost acceptable.

We actually believe that reason will win out over falsehoods. WRONG. \n\nTrump is talking to the fight/flight survival part of the brain that always wins out over reason. Demagogues have known this from time immemorial. \n\nThe mass majority loathe reason and intellectual arguments. They are not interested in reality.  They LOVE Trump because he talks to their fears and fantasies.  \n\nHillary was far too reasonable, logical, and sane.

Several of the fathers in our neighborhood were machinists at Boeing.  There was no difference in the standard of living of their families and ours.\n\nIn the 1970s, Boeing underwent a severe crisis; like many other defense contractors it was hit hard by the end of the Vietnam War.  It downscaled drastically, and then slowly rebuilt itself as a global corporation.  By the 1980s, Boeing was breaking its unions by telling them, \"OK, you don't like that, we'll just build it overseas.\"  And I hear from a current Boeing employee that a preponderance of floor workers are foreign (mostly Asian) and don't even speak English well enough to take directions from a supervisor who can't speak their language.

Each is a testament to the obvious, that not everyone who plays the game ends up damaged for life.\n\nIn fact, rare is the football coach who did not play the game himself. In Oregon's case, each of these 10 individuals now earns, when incentives are factored in, more than the president of the United States. You can argue about misplaced priorities, but from a practical standpoint the average Oregon football player could do a lot worse during his post-playing career than to follow in the footsteps of his college coaches.\n\nFemales suffer brain injuries playing sports, too.

Yes, the fossil fuel plants would tend to produce CO2 while some rot channels produce methane.  Folks like to say methane is bad.  But here is the rub.  The half life of methane in the atmosphere is about a decade.  The half life of CO2 in the atmosphere is centuries.

I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

The idea of building affordable housing in transit oriented development along the rail line will only create more traffic (if you can imagine it), as most people who live in the TODs and commute to work in town will take their cars, and not the rail.  To create affordable housing, zoning from Kalihi to Kahala should be changed to increase housing density to allow low rise apartments.  That would create a huge supply of housing, and bring prices down.",

And yet the odds of being injured by a bear would be higher for bikers than hikers. As I attempted to point out, there are no national or statewide figures for numbers of people who hike or bike in bear country, so comparisons are difficult, although in one instance reported by Herrero in Banff, it was evident that bikers were more at risk.

The skipper of another boat ended up in the water and died this last opener. He was a long time friend of mine from back when I started in this fishery. Before the inside was totally closed to us, we were only allowed to fish one opener per week to let extra kings up the river.

My first home mortgage required more than 50% of my net income. It was, a times, at  struggle and it was a tiny, tiny property. But it was also the late 70's and my income increased significantly over the next few years and soon I had some breathing room.\n \nBuying a first home has never been real easy. Nor should it.\n\nWhile Rob and others argue that things are different this time.

I'm not a big fan of 'hitter-only' DHs, but in TO and the AL East, he'll be fine, and when all is said and done, fans may not notice too much difference between he and EE.  \nHaving said that, home runs are great, but home runs on their own don't win ball games.  Good pitching will always defeat power hitting.  This TO team has been to the playoffs twice and failed to advance.  Meanwhile, its teams like KC, SF, NYM, Clev, ChiCubs, which feature far less overall power, who have been successful.  It should be clear to everyone that TO needs to get more versatile.  I like EE, JB, but this team needs more speed and balance (ie Fowler) if they hope to win a WS.  There's enough right-handed power with JD, TT, RM, who are also top-notch defensively.  I'd rather replace EE, JB with options that are better at manufacturing runs and offer defensive upside.",

Male privilege is a dominant reason and excuse for the culture of sexual harassment and abuse, widely thought to originate from the element of power not sexuality, although it is expressed in sexual ways.  The institutional Church has shown in many ways to support and even lobby for its right to actual discrimination in employment matters, and it expresses complete misogyny in its continuing refusal to consider women for ordination and therefore leadership.

Christie proposes a distinctively contemplative approach to ecological thought and practice that can help restore our sense of the earth as a sacred place. Christie argues that, at the most basic level, it is the quality of our attention to the natural world that must change if we are to learn how to live in a sustainable relationship with other living organisms and with one another. He notes that in this uniquely challenging historical moment, there is a deep and pervasive hunger for a less fragmented and more integrated way of apprehending and inhabiting the living world - and for a way of responding to the ecological crisis that expresses our deepest moral and spiritual values.\"\n\nA Contemplative ecology!",

It was the love of creation, the incarnate expression of God, dormant, living, suffering, singing that the new Pope saw was needed. \nHe sees the differentiation of Church/creation, religious/secular, \"thesis/antithesis\" approaching a critical point of antipathy and the need for a integration possible only at an incremental level. It is time for the institution, like Jesus, to become incarnate and risk; for those prepared to respond.\nThe notion of marriage is the risk, leap of faith in other, mutually.\nThe metaphor: \"leap\" of mutuality in-\nsoul bearing friendship\npeership\naccountability\natonement and growth\ndiscernment, nurturing, security of intimacy\nActions to words?

Would anyone seriously accept David Gibson as an authoritative commentator upon the Catholic Church?\nI am a failed seminarian and my initial reaction was to blame the Church for my failure and to turn against it.  The wisdom which comes with age eventually disabused me of that frame of mind: obviously the wisdom of age has passed Gibson by and he continues to pursue his vendetta.\nNeither Chaput nor Benedict desired a smaller Church; they predicted that it would be the result of the creeping secularisation within the Catholic Church: a secularisation Pope Francis seems to be content to allow to continue.",

I am sure its 4,600 employees are kept busy. Why talk about surplus? Maybe as an opportunity to pat oneself on the back for good stewardship? Lots of things in the gospels about that. It would be nice if we in the US had a surplus, even after the trillions we've spent on wars (since the early 1990's). Needless to say, we don't want bunglers , in church or state.",

Bringing the death penalty into this discussion is merely a distraction and a red herring.\n\nFace it. A woman's right to choose is the law of the land, and supported by a majority of Americans. You might not agree or like that, but it is a real fact. Adoption as a mandated alternative to legal abortion? Get real, that's fantasy and wishful thinking. Thousands of unborn fetuses are doomed from the moment they're conceived. Most will never be adopted. They will never have capable or responsible parents.

I've seen lots of locals/businesses/developers disrespect the land much worse. The best thing about the food trucks is that it gives the area some soul and personality. It's not the typical fast food joint, it's not a big corporate gig, and it's far from town. It's small business, it's artistic, gives people a chance to live their dreams and also an job/income creator. Find a way to provide proper amenities, permits and parking, as I'd like to see more soul and less ego drive the economy. Also, make recycling a priority at all beach parks with composting bins included with information board. You can't stop the people from coming, especially since the state advertises and relies so heavily on tourism.",

And Mr. Ota (thank you for your service) believes that free speech only applies to those with whom he agrees. That doesn't mean employers don't have the right to control the actions of their employees during working hours, but no one else has the right to curtail nonviolent protest.",

The author acknowledges that it's a complicated issue yet I fear the mention of the big players in the food chain is a scapegoat tactic. It makes us feel good to call out the bad players in a general sense. It allows us to feel good about our own believies without having a moral responsibility. Rather, we should analyze our own role in the issue and how we might be contributing to the problem. This is an issue directly related to poverty. As socio-economic status increases, this problem decreases. How much of your income have you given to Catholics Charities or the poor? Do you help tutor less fortunate students? Have you supported religious organizations that serve the poor? Those are much harder questions that demand a response from us.",

USFWS is the biggest proponent of predator control in the country and their reasoning is hypocritical at best.  What else isn't being discussed is the regulations implemented the BIDEH (Biological Integrity, Diversity, and Environmental Health) policy which turned conservation units into preservation units, again ILLEGAL!  It was a great day when congress overturned these regulations.  \nIf Alaskans don't like this type of wildlife management then change the state constitution, state statue and federal law.

Its only material asset is a carried interest in a former US subsidiary, Lighthouse Resources, Inc. LRI was formed by Ambre Energy Limited to acquire and operate coal mines in the United States of America, and to develop coal export terminals on the US West Coast. It is now owned by Resource Capital Funds.\"\n\nInteresting that our archaic 1872 mining law still allows foreign entities to claim, dig, and develop minerals like coal on American soil. Apart from a few jobs, we'd probably see little or no tax payments and could end up with the extensive pollution and site clean up costs so common to mining.\n\nCanada, in a more youthful stage of resource exploitation than the US, rolls over to accommodate the big extractors a little easier than we do.\n\n\"Based in Utah\"... I wonder if Utah gets any taxes or benefits from LRI?",

For example, our 10 kW rooftop solar system has produced around 100,000 kWh over the seven years since it was installed, while our driving 140,000 electrically powered km has only used around 30,000 kWh. EVs are so efficient that they will not pose a serious problem to the power grid and can help to stabilize the grid by providing dispatchable power demand (and potentiality dispatchable power supply).",
