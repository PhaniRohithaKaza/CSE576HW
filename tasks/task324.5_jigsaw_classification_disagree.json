Can you not decide which way to turn? If a priest is leading, his parishioners are, ipso facto, his inferiors, in the sense that they must follow his naturally 'superior' lead.\n\nYou keep missing my point: priests are commanded by Christ to be servants, not masters.

For a conservative like Wall to be for CCS and against carbon pricing is just plain stupid. Nobody in their right mind will purchase it except for specific industrial applications, i.e., not as part of a global carbon reduction strategy.\n\nOn top of that, it is still experimental.

Some are likely to be non-contentious. But even those that are will have to be tested in court. Best we wait and see the result before declaring saying the president is acting illegally.\n\nFinally, which of Trump's orders has drawn the most ire from some quarters? His 90-day suspension of immigration from seven countries. Given the authority assumed by previous presidents for guarding the security of the USA- without any push-back from the public- Trump's order is exceedingly moderate.

He wins because he is the ONLY person saying what people feel on issues like immigration and trade and he is not a politician.

Many people don't know about 'knock out' years, of which you're only allowed 7 or 8.  If you've been paying yourself dividends instead of salary for a while, then you may need to take your CPP at 60, to maximize your pay out.  All a bit beside the point.\nThe fact is that the government will only let us defer just so much tax, and then we have to pay the piper.

Indeed, many struggle everyday to make ends meet including keeping up with rental payments to avoid eviction and homelessness. Sadly, Micronesians do make up the homeless population in Hawaii which tends to be exaggerated in terms of their numbers.

It was one of the first 6000 vehicles of that model.  I had one issue with a rear passenger window that Tesla fixed within a day at no cost to me.  They even came to my work to pick up the car and give me a high end Model S as a loaner.\n\nThe sum total of maintenance that I've done in 4 years is to replace windshield wipers, fill the windshield wiper fluid, put on snow tires, and wash the car.

If a coach is so bad that a player who loves the game and his school would rather not play or move to a different school says a lot.  If a coach cannot attract even the minimum numbers of players to field a team ensures the lack of opportunity for the players to compete.  \n\nThe bottom line is that results matter whether you are a coach, an educator, a businessman or a politician.",

If you do have a Smart meter the cost varies from 8.7 to 18 cents/kWh. According to the Ontario Energy Board the average household uses 2/3 of their electricity during off-peak hours.  For San Francisco the 2016 average cost is 19.5 cents/kWh. What is not shown in either case are distribution costs and other administrative costs.\n\nSo electricity prices are not so low in the US they are higher than in Ontario.\n\nGasoline is another story. In Toronto we currently pay  about $1.09/L which is $4.12/gallon.  The US average for 2016 is $2.20/gallon. This is from the same data source.

Being different-which gay kids often are-can result in kids being vulnerable and unprotected: isolated socially through rejection and neglect by parents, friends, churches and schools. Pedophiles seek a child upon whom they can act their own sexual needs; some prefer girls, some prefer boys, some don't care: all are looking for a child vulnerable and isolated in a way that will allow the adult to commit a crime undetected. That is why gay children are frequent targets: WE make them vulnerable to abuse.",

Then the three oil companies sell Alaska the gas at current market wholesale price minus what they owe in royalties. Alaska gets the gas to Nikiski, liquify it sell it at a market retail price, and Alaska makes a few pennies per cf, while the three big oil companies share no risk at all, no maintenance, nothing.

Without that concept, the rest means nothing.\n\nI believe very strongly that to the degree that there is divine influence on the church, that influence comes from our combined wisdom and experience.  There's a reason, for example, the story of Lot remains in the bible, and resonates even today.  Human suffering is very difficult to explain.  Yet, beauty and wisdom can emerge from that, as it can from so many other areas of human experience.  THAT gift is where the divine resides.  When we interact with each other, we're sharing that wisdom, that pain, that joy, that love (etc.)  THAT'S what we have to work with today.  The church's leadership plays this game of saying \"no new revelation,\" while pretty much also stating \"... and we hold it all, so you have to obey.\"  rubbish.

The royal College of Physicians has endorsed e-cigarettes as an effective alternative to cigarettes and has given the vapor industry a path to continued success overseas-unlike the FDA's ruling last week, which will effectively wipe out 99% of the e-cigarette industry by forcing manufacturers to undergo a multimillion dollar application process that most cannot afford. Big government and big business want to snuff us out and shed a negative light on the industry, but the fact is, there is just too much evidence pointing towards e-cigarettes being the revolutionary alternative to the ever-growing tobacco problem. We have the power to save millions of lives by doing everything we can to promote vaping instead of hinder it's progress. We are all for common sense regulations, but the FDA has overstepped their bounds.",

In too many cases, the folks with capital are themselves in government and quite corrupt: they are trying to get the money out before the regime collapses.  Sending more aid is not the answer since if the aid is cash, you might as well just send it directly to numbered accounts in Switzerland.  I don't doubt some of that bad governance is encouraged by foreign companies and countries where it is to their advantage.

If american corporations were not raking in the profits from this spending ... I doubt we would be going into decades long wars \"by tragedies of compounded mistakes\".  AND - those profiting most from wars ... are not the weapons manufacturers as I thought ... it is the financial corporation who lend governments the funds to go prepare for or go to war.  \n\nGiven David H. Koch and some banks were \"significant\" contributors to this epic - is that why the fact each bullet; tank, plane, helicopter; fuel costs us the tax-payer $ while profiting not only the manufacturers of weapons of mass destruction, but those who finance this insanity not mentioned.\n\nWe need to raise our voices loud and clear.",

I like that FWSD is developing something consistent for ALL schools. Way to go.\nAnd to Scott, this isn't about student behavior; there are outside dangers posed by mentally ill people and natural disasters. things have changed since the sixties and even the 90s when I was in school in Eastern Washington.

While I am the first to agree that no single weather event can be blamed on climate change, it is certainly true is that some elements of our climate are certainly changing. And they are changing beyond normal cyclical trends and the changes are increasingly rapid. I probably suggested years ago that you study a short course on climate change.

Did you make decisions that were totally against what your parents advised/told you not to do?  Were some of those decisions \"adult\" decisions?  I'm sure that for probably 99+% of people the answer to that is 'yes'.  So, charge the parents you say?  For what exactly?  Are these kids runaways?  Are they emancipated?  What?  The fact that you have no clue as to why they were there, or with this guy, yet you're jumping to conclusions as to what needs to happen just shows you are both ignorant, and closed-minded.  Now don't take that out of context, the guy was clearly wrong and if the allegations against him are true then he should be charged accordingly, but....don't forget that kids that age are given adult rights, say like to drive, and they need to be held accountable as well.

Day tells us that at 23 years old DIA is obsolete, then wants to commit the City to a 34 year plan. Huh?

Many say that he should just hand over the records to the police and get it over with. \n\nHe did in the case in Spain and that didn't turn out as successfully as people think because of the statute of limitations. And there are a whole host of other recommendations. Hand over Bernard Law. Remove the Pontifical Secret. Prosecute bishops. Prosecute priests(which he has done on some occasions). Meet sex abuse victims(which he has on some occasions).

Fair enough, but it isn't always about money. If it was we wouldn't have the Irish or the Ukranians, or other waves of past immigrants.\n\nBut more to the point, and why I feel Harper was being malicious, is his transparent antipathy to anything and anyone in the Middle East with the exception of that single country whose every action Harper would approve unconditionally and without reservation.\n\nSyrian refugees languished, intentionally, for a long time, until we elected a government compassionate and visionary enough to finally remove the administrative roadblocks preventing them from coming to Canada.\n\nThanks again for your commentary.",

By this I mean that the Bernieites who sold us old dems down the river ala the Ralph Nader experience (did they learn nothing in school about recent presidential third party failures and the mess which is left over?) in the last election seem to have it too easy.

That's about 100,000 more than ALL the classes of immigrants accepted in Canada last year.  Back then, the Canadian population was about 7 million.

There could have been, but there was none. … we call upon those who term themselves modern humanists, and who have renounced the transcendent value of the highest realities, to give the Council credit for one quality and to recognize our own new type of humanism; we, too, in fact, we more than any others, honor man; we have the Cult of Man”.\n\nhttp://www.cfnews.org/page10/page83/paul_vi_beatified.html",

Public Sector worker includes teachers and health care workers, Federal employees, the Military, municipal workers and University employees, and an assortment of mom and pop businesses are the driving force of the economy. The upper class is present in the Province but do not have the same influence that their cohorts in other parts of the country enjoy. And there are too many unemployed or underemployed. Therefore, when Provincial Governments slow down wage increases for government workers they are in fact slowing down the overall economy. Lowering the tax base.

How many of these protesting scientists are vegan?

Scientific studies have shown that the consumption of animal-based food is by far the single biggest contributor to human-generated climate change.

In my experience, some teachers/departments took care of their textbooks, required students to protect them with paper covers, kept an inventory, and held students accountable for lost or damaged-beyond-repair books.  Others took little care of the $50 per copy books because, when they were lost, textbooks were considered a necessity and one could always get money to replace them or even buy brand new sets.

The problem with cutting retirements and benefits and not keeping pace with inflation for wages however is it is getting harder and harder to hire people and even harder to retain the ones we have. Especially in the lower paying towns. If you are having to hire cops to replace the ones that leave every 2 years you are paying 36% more per cop because it takes up to 8 months to train the officers and get them on their own. That 8 months is the combined total of the academy and Field training.  It is actually cheaper to pay people a bit more to retain them or offer better benefits than it is to treat them like they are disposable. As for inflation I have been doing this for 17 years. I entered my wages into an inflation calculator and 17 years later I am only making $3 an hour more in real money from when I started. Health care costs have gone through the roof in the same time.",

The 2011 \"translation\" can be wiped off the ritual at the stroke of a pen, and new wording put in place.  The USCCB has a great opportunity at this point, of making the Mass a really inclusive prayer.

If that is so, then resources in other marginal or negative programs should be moved to school meals and expand the program for QUALIFIED families.  Additionally, it would lend support for year round schooling (which I support).\n\nI'll still have to think and research about this some more.

He only technically won because of the ridiculous electoral college system, the rise of fake news, and a segment of voters registering a protest vote against neoliberalism. Is all. Polls say Obama's popular, they are correct polls, and a little simple fact and some math explain why this is so. The Dems will be back in 4 years. Enjoy the clown show while it lasts, folks.

Above those limits, you pay the tax.  But you can hold money in your corporation; you'll only pay tax on the proceeds of the investment.   If you're holding a large amount of money in a corporation for a very long time, you could well take a 30% haircut on the money.  But you would have to pay more if you defer the withdrawal for too long, than if you had taken out the money as you went along and paid the tax.  The solution isn't to leave the money in and pay the 30%.   Take the money out, and pay the tax as you go along.  If the money is genuinely needed for dry periods, the investment proceeds and resulting tax aren't going to be anywhere near 30%.",

Or, as I stated in an earlier comment, perhaps the restaurant can SELL permanent plastic containers with their logo on it so you initially buy maybe 3-4, then get a discount every time you bring it back.  Eventually they will pay for themselves.  The containers at Zippy's, for example, are so good that we reuse them like Tupperware, and they're microwaveable, too.

In other parts of the world a diluent is used to extract heavy oil and in several parts of the Canadian tar sands programs a diluent is used to blend with their heavy crude to transport the heavy oil in pipelines.  We can do the same thing on the North Slope with a diluent to help extract this heavy oil and assist in the transport down TAPS to Valdez.  The diluent is recovered at the refinery and turned into valuable products.  Diluent will have a higher value than the heavy crude oil.  So the natural gas already on the North Slope can be turned into valuable liquids which can be shipped down TAPS to market and it can also be used to create a diluent to help extract and transport this heavy oil.

Furthermore, he demonstrates an appalling ignorance: Iraq's oil reserves are estimated to be about 150 billion barrels. Extracting that much oil would take at least half a century, yet Trump asserts, \"I would have taken the oil\" as if it's something that one could slip into a suitcase.\n\nOne of President Trump's first pronouncements was directed at China.

There is no acknowledgement of Burke's prior actions.\nAt best, this may become a show trial, to demonstrate how the Church is taking all of this seriously.

As far as a Party riding candidate representing the riding electorate is concerned - wrong.  Party candidates represent the Party and will act in Parliament according to Party dictat.  The only riding candidate who is even remotely responsible to the riding is the Independent and even then, personal philosophy over-rides how the riding may feel on a particular issue.  No external force may subvert the Will of Parliament.\n\nWhat the riding electorate does when voting is to choose the candidate who most closely expresses the electorate sentiment but an MP has NO legal obligation to the riding in Parliament.  Like it or not, that's how the Westminster system works.  The best the electors can hope for is that the elected MP actually does behave as they believed during the election campaign and at the risk of ejection from caucus, but that's as far as it goes.  Until the next election.",

Any successful businessman can list many failures. Trump can do that as well. So what? \nI never defended Trump's inappropriate statements but I have forgiven him.\nThere are obviously plenty of folks who like Trump's plans for the economy, immigration and American values.

Mount McKinley isn't just an Alaskan mountain, but the highest mountain in the United States, and in North America. It doesn't just belong to Alaska but to the whole. Denali from all I read, is nothing but a bastardized colonial name by English speaking folks who can't pronounce the real native name. Isn't the real name \" Dghelay Ka'a\" or something close to that. And it doesn't represent all native people, just the people of the immediate area. There are other names for Mount McKinley of course. Naming a place for someone who never been there isn't anything new. Just look at Washington State, named after George Washington for example. I see nothing wrong with honoring a mountain named after a man who served our nation during the Civil War from the ranks on up and assassinated when he was the President of United States.",

We do.  We can easier accept that mental health issues can bring a person to psychosis where\nhe carries out a violent act, but it is more difficult for most of us to accept the pre-meditated violence carried out by for example ISIS.

I enjoy reading and writing philosophy, science fiction and other creative, analytical things; politics is a different sort of animal these days with preferred social positions being important and conformity to group think vital for promotion. Sometimes one can get politicians to take a different direction suggested by those not in politics. While in the job of politics working mundane technical things its challenging to get new or creative ideas-they must come from people outside the pile.\n\nSteve Cowper once submitted a bid for the Super Conducting Super-Collider-that was creative, though Texas won the competition and the project wasn't completed.

That is way above what margins most companies make on the JSE. Discovery Medical scheme trustees are failing, in that they are not asking why they are overpaying to such an extent. Their previous KPMG report checked whether they get value for money, but apparently did not question whether they should be paying less, in fact. Having multiple schemes leads to competition and innovation. If you only have one or two, that aspect falls away, which is bad for everyone. One can have a virtual pooling of risk in a Risk Equalisation Fund without physical pooling in one or two schemes.  All the positives of pooling, along with competition still happening to drive innovation. One does need change to keep the industry sustainable, but radically reducing funds to one or two is not the way to go. Fewer schemes is fine, but one or two is too few. Restructuring options is another way to help",

These are the two otoliths, more commonly called ear bones, located on either side of the fishes head. Every fish has them and the every species has a different shape of otolith. They are usually only 2 or 3 millimeters wide in Alaska fish and they grow as the fish does and gets growth rings so they can be used to tell the fishes age.

That doesn't go away under the proposed American Health Care Act. 3) Going the asset protection route might very well be sensible from an individual's point of view, but it means that those that pay for insurance before they \"need\" it, like me, will be the ones that pay for the cost of your care, should you or your family end up with an expensive, serious, medical situation.

The idea that a few trappers and hunters can continue with game board continued  approval, to bait and kill wandering wildlife from a national park that is a virtual gold mine for its wildlife experiences for its visitors is hard to understand, even for one following our legislature's centuries old thinking as they consider relevant legislation and confirmation of more hunters and trappers on this game board (AKA as Alaska Board of Trappers and hunters). Look hard beyond Safari Club's and NRA's and Alaska Outdoor Council's and Alaska Professional Hunters Association's iron grip on Alaska wildlife management and you'll see stuff to cause real concern.  A small minority running the Alaska wildlife show for decades on end. It's a sick and sickened system needing total overhaul. The continuing Denali wolf debate is a microsim of an ongoing statewide wildlife debacle, yes it is.  Look hard.  See for yourselves.",

The clock will not turn back, nor even run slower. Like Canada's own indigenous peoples, Tibetans have been overwhelmed by a more powerful group. The Tibetan people are being assimilated and their lands are being exploited. I have great empathy for the Tibetans and their way of life.

I preferred that the Chief's hiring and firing be left to the Mayor and the City Council.  If memory serves me correct, when the hiring of outside counsel was placed on council agenda, the entire council agreed that the city was duty bound to provide representation to one of its principle employees.

A single woman with a couple of kids can get the equivalent of about $60,000/yr of taxable income in Housing subsidies, EITC, SNAP, WIC, etc. with just a minimum wage part time job, and she can count her kids a dependents thru age 25.  It would be irrational for her to get a full time job that pays more unless it pays $60,000 more.\n\nAnd here's the catch.  If her kids get a job and earn a reportable, taxable income, it can reduce her benefits.  The only way they can bring more income into the house without reducing mom's benefits is under the table, via crime.  Works fine 'til you get caught.

I'm not sure the city needs something separate. If the city decides that camping isn't allowed in that particular spot it can have the people move to a place where camping is permitted, correct?

I seem to recall the public relations creation of the sports car owning tenant happily accumulating wealth and taking luxurious vacations because of decades spent living in rent controlled apartments. The idea was to allow rents to be raised to market value; the reality was landlords finding any excuse to evict tenants in order to rent to a new tenant at a higher rent. The newly created rent tribunal assisted landlords greatly in this endeavour. Result was a massive increase in homelessness, documented in the Golden Report on Homelessness and Poverty.  Harris' other action was to stop the Ontario government from building new rental housing, which also coincided with Ottawa getting out of building affordable housing. TCHC then decided that salaries and head office renovations took precedence over repairs and thus we have the current crisis. .",

Otherwise, as we have with pensions, we will have a public sector workers retiring 15 years sooner than the private sector, with far better pensions.
