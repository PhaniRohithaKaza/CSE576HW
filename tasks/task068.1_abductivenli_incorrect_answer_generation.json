    "Definition": "Given a three-part story, alter the middle sentence slightly by adding or removing not more than 4 words to make the story inconsistent, improbable or unlikely. Do not just negate the given middle sentence and try to reduce the redundancy by not providing unrelated information.",

                "explanation": "The middle sentence of this story is altered such that it made the story inconsistent. The actual middle sentence was that he refused to be bullied. The modified middle sentence is that he got bullied as he did not stand for himself."
