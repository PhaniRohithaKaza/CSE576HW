    "Definition": "In this task, you will be given a debate topic, along with a sentence from the debate. You should classify the given sentence and choose the type of sentence. Politics: This refers to a sentence that suggests a particular course of action. It typically contains modal verbs such as \"should\" and \"ought.\" It cannot be directly backed up by objective evidence, and an appropriate form of support is a logical reason from which the sentence can be derived. Value: This refers to a sentence that contains value judgments without making specific assertions about what should be done (if so, it is a political sentence.) Due to the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be backed up directly by objective evidence. Fact: This refers to an objective statement that expresses or treats facts or conditions, as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable. Testimony: This refers to an objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases. Reference: This refers to a reference to a source of objective evidence. It is typically a citation or a URL of a published work from a renowned source.",
