There's no democratic mandate for the Denver Police to plea fealty to Donald J Trump.

The 7 named countries are places of conflict and terrorist activity or terrorist base.  Mr Trump's ban does not include a much larger number of majority-Muslim countries.  There isn't a religious exclusion for immigrants. \n\nAny immigrant or refugee applicant should be screened for acceptance of Canadian/American values. \n\nOn multiculturalism is that in the case of the US, they want to be Americans, while up here it sometimes seems as though being Canadian is second and first is to maintain the old country here.

There are different ways to arrange it, but all games must carry the same weight; otherwise it's slanted and cannot be justified.\n\nIf you want the 3 pt system, fine.  A win in reg is then worth 3 pts to the winning team.  Under that set-up, Bos is 4 pts clear of Your Leafs.\n\nIf you wanna go 2 pts, then Bos is only 1 pt up.  Your Leafs have 1 game in hand.\n\nThere is no justification for awarding 2 pts to a team that was 5-0 in reg, and awarding 2 pts again to a team that wins 4-3 in a 12-round SO.  Flawed.",

Yet instead of becoming one of us and supporting the U.S. flag---they proudly hang the flag of the country they came from , from their car mirrors.  We should be one nation and loudly condemn anyone who would destroy our flag.  Instead , we want to destroy the flag and traditions that make us American's.

As was made plain by their questioning of former FBI director James Comey and the three intelligence chiefs last week, Democrats have moved the goalposts on the Russia investigation. They’ve all but given up on their quest to prove the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election — the charge at the heart of the ongoing congressional investigations. They are now solely focused on pinning a charge on President Trump and ultimately forcing him from office. With the collapse of the collusion narrative, they’ve seized upon “obstruction of justice” as the accusation that will, they hope, get Trump impeached",

We are a church locked in a perpetual early adolescence, unable to talk about those dirty things that have been branded by horribly conflicted men (starting with that psychological mess Augustine) who hide their own activities and the sins of others.  But we do have a model to do so and that is Vatican II.  And a \"patron saint\" of such a movement would have to be (St.) John XXIII who feared nothing in open discussion.

When someone as young as 12 gets pregnant--in the mind of the liberal, the problem isn't that the 12 year old had sex, the problem is that the 12 year old didn't have \"safe\" sex.

Maybe I read this wrong, if I did, then never mind! I don't think this was written well, it has no detail or objective, no why, or what their ultimate goal is. If I wrote like this in sixth grade Mrs. Drumm would have made me write it over till I got it right, or at least understandable. So why and what is their true agenda? It's Monday, I  mixed chemicals today and asked of my boss a simple math equation, Me not smart sometimes!",

So, this is where the intersection of peace, order and good government meets a country so stoned on weed that its productivity gradually stalls, falls, and we are open season for the take over of our lands by foreign investors. On a larger scale than is already allowed. They should never make it legal as planned. It should simply be removed from the schedule of prohibited drugs. .

The Russians went on planning despite the politics.  In 1868 with the AK Purchase The Russians were given a choice to stay or go back. Many of the Russians who did stayed later scrambled to leave as law and order ended. The territory was now in total chaos. Mobs and gangs ruled and many innocent people died at their hands.

The priest suggested that we try it, for just 9 months (a good gestation period?) - at the end of that time we, the congregation, would discuss it and have a vote. In the meantime, he taught into the changes each week, paragraph by paragraph. It is the first time the majority had experienced the 'new' liturgy regularly. At the end of 9 mths the majority were overwhelmingly in favour of the new and did not want to revert. There were of course a few who still did not like it, but even they - out of love for the others - agreed and the new liturgy was accepted.

Do you really believe that this percentage of Americans is racist? Ridiculous.\n\nAlmost every time I hear someone say that Trump is a racist, the explanation given is that he called Mexicans rapists, murderers, etc. But a fair reading of what he said is that too great a percentage of those coming here illegally are criminals. He was right about that. Latino illegal aliens are significantly over-represented in the federal prison population.  It's not racist to point that out, or to point out that we're importing a population that is, on the whole, too violent and too criminal for our own good.

When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2008, many U.S. home-owners were trapped \"under-water\". And now many Canadian home-owners could be trapped with increased mortgage payments.

The move to pick up another nose tackle is strange, because wouldnt you want to replace a DE with a DE?\n\nWith the upcoming game vs. dallas, we replace a DE with a NT.  Funny timing to be going for depth at nose tackle when were still banged up at the position.\n\nSo what if this is a move to put a HUGE NT at the DE position for this game?  A game vs the best offensive linemen in the league.\n\nI would be SO HAPPY if Coach Joe was capable of this kind of \"outside the box\" thinking.  Use physics.  Stuff the best running team by fielding two nose tackles per play.  Just monster block eaters.  Take their big O linemen and match them with bigger opponents.\n\nLeave the pass rush to the linebackers.\n\nId love the move because it adds a \"you never know what the Broncos will do\" element that the Hated Patriots have enjoyed under the evil Belichick.\n\nSun Tzu would start two nose tackle.",

This, at the heart, is a crisis of family.\n\nThe Church understands sex better than any other human institution. The issue is that anytime they say something people don't like people tend to put their fingers in their ears.\n\nSt.JPII will eventually be declared a Doctor of the Church due to his Theology of the Body.

Further, there is a disturbing trend for social tensions generated by these gaps to be attributed without proof to newcomers and foreign investors, mainly ethnic Chinese, rather than to domestic causes.\n\nAlberta's new Government is with mixed success trying to redress these problems under very difficult economic conditions.

If those estimates are correct - 4 to 6 degrees - then the temperature difference was most likely higher at the poles. \n\nYes, CO2 does cause warming, but it is obvious to anyone not willfully blind that the rate of warming is much lower than in the model-based disaster scenarios that were popularized by Hansen. Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever of negative consequences of this moderate warming. The hysteria is unfounded.",

Martin, for his part, exhorts us to reject Church teaching on homosexuality, and to regard homosexual CONDUCT (as distinct from the state of simply being homosexual) as perfectly acceptable, sinless.

States, while they can issue debt, don't really have the same powers in that regard as the Federal government.  And it makes sense really - would you buy bonds issued by a state to cover that state's current operating expenses?  I wouldn't, that indicates the state is in dire financial condition.

I wondered if that omission was intentional due to her ideology.  I am amazed at the anti-Catholic-dogmatic rhetoric in this piece.  It is abundantly clear that you have issues with the Catholic Church.   You state that 60% of Catholic voters feel abortion can be a moral choice.  How can one make a moral choice on an immoral act?  Francis is more concerned with the salvation of souls before climate change.  The issues you mentioned are noteworthy not primary.  A vote for Mr. Trump, is a vote against Mrs. Clinton who supports partial birth abortion, left the men in Benghazi to die, runs a fraudulent foundation,  & deceived the citizenry. By not supporting Trump, then you are avowing that Mrs,. Clinton has superior character. Really! Accountability now, or before the face of God.",

It is because union leadership are involved in some shady deals. Mostly with political parties and so one has to wonder what's in this forth Trudeau and the LPC? And why do they fear a secret ballot? I think that the very public card system is where the real intimidation and bullying takes place by union goons. Saying that an employer can intimidate an employee through a secret ballot is so laughable no thinking person can even take it seriously. No matter because the right to work movement will make all this a moot point anyway. The genie is out of the bottle in the US so Canada will have to adapt and allow it or there will be no unionized workers left anyway because these companies will move to the US to get away from them.",

She is cramped on 18 hour flights to Japan and Australia and China, etc. But she does it and doesn't complain. There are no perks for federal employees.  NONE. The fed system is a fair system.  Fed employees are paid fairly and they get an okay per diem.  They can only stay at hotels who charge \"gov't rates.\"  (Meaning regular hotels - not fancy hotels.) These \"non profits\" need to comply with federal rules and regs as they are funded by fed $$$$.",

It seems funny how that was okay back then and now it's some how, not okay and should be illegal. What really is the American way? It was okay to annihilate the Native people back in the day, but now it's considered an affront to human rights? This country promoted things like slavery, confinement camps and taking of property for natural born citizens in the case of the Japanese during ww2, the use and abuse of Chinese and Irish laborers, etc.!

Others believe that Shakespeare was inspired by the works of the great Roman historian Tacitus.  Whatever the case, Shakespeare didn't speak Italian and it's unlikely he ever set foot in Italy. Does this diminish the credibility and/or impact of his work? Does it render him an appropriator? Shakespeare would no doubt be utterly mystified by the modern debate about cultural appropriation.

Actually, that's not true. I am increasingly of the mind that they are absolutely unwilling to deliver such a program. I base this conclusion on the fact that real estate/construction has swelled to over 25% of BC's GDP and is the sole bright spot for jobs in our economy. I base this on donor lists to all levels of governments, on top of the material interests of politicians who also have extensive real estate holdings. I base this on the record % of Canadian households (i.e. voters) who \"own\" homes now (something like 70%).\n\nMany of these interests don't want to face the long-term downsides of accumulating this much debt, of alienating young talent/skills/future tax base, of de-diversifying our economy and grabbing the near-term buck, etc. Effective taxation may be sensible long-term thinking, but how often does that influence governance?",

I expected her to help and hold people accountable.  Instead she sent me an email stating that I was being \"threatening\" and \"out of line\".  I was shocked, saddened, but at the same time it gave me hope for greater change.  The email was evidence of a high level coverup and begged the question what else is being swept under the rug.  I knew I had to go public so this could be investigated.  I immediately contacted Civil Beat upon receiving the email.  Shortly after I was suspended.  A month later I was banned from working at any Hawaii DOE sites indefinitely.  \n\nI spent 5 years earning half a living wage (12K) so I could be credentialed and be promoted to a position paying 4-5 times more money.  I struggled and went without so I could make this my career and they all robbed me.",

The argument that one's immigrant ancestors eventually stopped transmitting their particular language does not hold water here.  Immigrating was a choice.  FNs were not given that choice.  Learn your history before you pass judgment.  Further than that, understand that in the rest of the world, knowing more than one language is far more common than in North America.  And there are plenty of ideas that don't translate from one language to another.  We will be poorer, as a species, indeed, if FN languages go extinct.",

No more watching the ups and downs of the market.  I'm following the annual dividend increases that I expect to take care of inflation in the coming years.  People need to re-access how they measure their investing success, and not worry so much about short term gains and losses in stock values.",

Unlike the Groper's exes, however, most first century women had no alimony to depend upon, which meant they usually had to resort to begging or prostitution in order to survive. Jesus understood this. I personally believe that Jesus would likewise understand that under today's law, releasing women (or men, for that matter) from an abusive marriage when they have something to fall back on is the right thing to do. You're engaging in fundamentalist thinking, and I agree with Maureen Fiebich that this is a situation in which the spirit rather than the letter of the law is what deserves respect.

(Note: no individual in a given generation is better or worse than an individual in any other generation.)\n\nI don't expect rates to spike in a massive way. But I do think you might be over-estimating the willingness of subsequent generations to be economically thwarted.\n\nIn the next 5-10 years, the majority of boomers will have exited the work force. Their significant clout at the ballot box will remain, but policies (including approaches to interest rates) will also need to accommodate those who are working. Those regions that keep policy focused very heavily on the boomers will see younger people move away (other cities, provinces, or countries), decimating the taxbase and leading to a loss of essential skills.",

Without fluoridated water we don't get the best coverage.  \n\nThe US has fluoridated for over 70 years and nearly 3 out of 4 Americans on public water systems get the benefit. Most of the Western world has water or salt fluoridation, water with already enough fluoride or socialized medicine. Clallam County is a dental professional shortage area. Fluoridation has been gone for a year and the people who took it away have no replacement solution. To be fair, it's because there really isn't one as cost effective - fluoride in water costs about a dollar a year per family member - filling a single cavity costs over a hundred.\n\nSequim could be doing better.

Add new technologies intersecting with materials' science, and we don't have a substantial domestic workforce anymore. We have a 'just in time' or gig economy.\n\nCanada has dished out approximately a million 10-year temporary resident visas EACH year since 2010 when the program began: 940,214 such visas in the first year -- but NO requirement to file income taxes as temp residents.. Add 300,000 new immigrants ... plus refugees. House prices UP, UP -- \n\nCanada must identify what it can do best instead of selling out to other nations. Too often, politicians tried to pick and subsidize economic 'winners'. Result: debts & deficits at all level. Technological change is SO rapid .. governments are slow and home to self-serving politicians.",

What's worse, is that Pope Francis' own penned letter to some bishops shows that he supports Holy Communion for adulterers living in the state of mortal sin, all the while calling it a pastoral practice of accompanying those persons. The truth is that when people in the state of mortal sin receive Holy Communion, they are NOT growing in holiness, but receive sacrilegiously and go deeper into sin, calling judgment down upon themselves.

Find out what the end result was of the ideas of your hero, Karl Marx. Studying economics without understanding history is dangerous.\nLastly, and you need to read this one last because it is the most difficult, make a careful study of George Orwell's Animal Farm.

We put some very attractive offers out late in Hickel but the unions decided they'd rather try to buy a Governor and angry employees with no contracts would help with that.  From '94 through '02 you had an Administration more interested in using State employees to play politics than it was in their wages, hours, and conditions.   We did a 0% rollover in '03 then  in '04 made a 3%/yr, 3 year offer that the unions accepted for Class 2/3 then a 4 - 3 -3% offer to the Class Ones, which the interest arbitrators accepted.

Civilian losses are inevitable when opposing sides fight over an urban district, and the rebels/terrorists were hardened. They adamantly refused to retreat, even under the protection of the numerous ceasefires that were offered. The deaths of the civilians therefore weigh heavily on them.\n\nMilitarily-speaking, the Syrian government has achieved a very important victory.

They say police protect the rich, taxes protect the poor.\n   For the most part, there are no bad people, only bad systems that make good people do bad things to other good people.\n  By and large, it's the rich and powerful who make the bad decisions, the poor and weak who suffer the bad results.

When Governor Ben Cayetano vetoed the tax credit bill, Hanabusa took the unprecedented step of suing to overturn the veto.\nWithin months, Hanabusa's then-fiancé John Souza received a preferential deal in purchasing one of Stone's homes in Ko Olina. In February 2005, less than two years after Souza bought the home, he sold it for a $421,000 profit, according to real estate records. Souza and Hanabusa, who were engaged at the time and married in 2008, then bought a $1-million home in another Ko Olina subdivision developed by Centex Homes of Texas.\nCorrupt!",

As a woman who lives in a family where four generations have experienced sexual assault and harassment over many years, the category rape culture seems apt.

The assaults on trans and other non-conforming identities are also terrible. It is not all men who do this of course but there is no question that a culture of toxic masculinity exists. I’m a teacher and have great admiration for the young people who are struggling with this issue now. They are not afraid to name injustice. The universities and other institutions need to make their policies more effective. Indigenous women are ten times as likely to be assaulted and the taunts and racist comments happen all the time.

This appeal stood in contrast (how much can be debated I suppose) to the so-called Obama playbook that Clinton attempted to replicate, namely an appeal to diverse coalitions on explicit grounds of race, ethnicity, gender, etc. Many Sanders supports continue to argue that the Sanders approach would have proved more successful insofar as it could have made headway into the White Rust Belt where Clinton failed.

Poaching is also a misdemeanor but was never prosecuted in state court. Most crimes on federal property are adjudicated locally. \nThe federal prosecutor rolled up 10 years of disputes with the Hammonds and took them to federal court but offered them a plea deal that involved no jail time. Of all the charges they were convicted of only the two fires they admitted to setting for reasons obviously not believed by the jury. Judge Hogan described the federal minimum for a crime clearly not in the same category as burning a building as cruel and unusual.

As well as the Spirit guiding, the human element in development is very strong. Indeed the Evil One is very keen to get in on the act of development to lead us astray.\n\nGiven both of these, I would suggest that the Eucharist is preeminently sacred food as evidenced by the the manner in which it was introduced by Jesus. There are two reasons, IMHO, for today downplaying the Eucharist as an object of adoration: (1) it was introduced and served for a long time to displace frequent reception, and (2) emphatic adoration outside of mass is a uniquely Catholic practice.

Maybe people could start over with Hillary and look at her with an open mind. Is everything said about her true? What do the best, most unbiased sources say? For instance,\nHillary does not rejoice in the death of infants, cackling happily every time a woman has an abortion, with a counter behind  her racking up the numbers. No, in fact, she wants fewer abortions. Rather than punish women, she wants to provide them with social services to encourage them to keep their children.\n\nWhy is it so hard for people to let go of their Hillary hatred?",

Cycling on single-track is a totally different experience where the trails are sometimes one-way to prevent injuries, to prevent some run-ins with others on the trails, and to prevent wear on the trails to become too much. Also, single-track trails are used almost exclusively for recreation. It is very rare that cyclists can use them for commuting or for access to other trails. Important, too, is that some of the multi-use trails are made inoperable by contractors trashing bridges to connect one part of a trail to another. That does not occur on single-track trails.

An eyewitness reported that this was precisely what was being done to James Fields. Taylor Lorenz of The Hill made several points:\n\nProtesters were chasing and attacking several cars\nShe herself was punched (ironically, though journalists shamelessly shill for them, Antifa often attack journalists because they don’t want their violence caught on camera)\nPolice at the station “think the guy running people down wasn’t malicious” and was “scared”\n\nMaybe there is more to the story?",

As a compulsive liar, Trump should know by now that consistency is important; you expose yourself if you can’t keep your lies straight. Trump approved Fredo's initial story, that it was a meeting about adoption. Trump also claimed that he learned about the meeting after the publication of Fredo's emails, but Trump's lawyer has had the emails for a couple of weeks. Trump claims that he learned of the meeting went the emails went public, but Kushner told him about the meeting a couple of weeks ago, when he revised his SF-86 application for the third time.

The fact that people are divided because of conflicted religious presumptions implies (proves) that religions are conflicted (in error) with respect to their laws.

For my 2000 BMW 323i, it was a whopping $30k before I finally gave up and towed it to the junk yard for the $3k EV Scrap-It rebate. So far, the LEAF costs~300/year for scheduled tire rotations and brake fluid flush. I expect to replace the LRR tires every 60K for another $3K.  I live at the top of a hill and chewed through brakes every 2 years. With regen, the LEAF is doing much better, say a brake job every 3 years for $1K. I can easily replace the battery out of maintenance savings. But there is absolutely no evidence that the battery will need replacement. I already accounted for capacity loss. When I lose 3 bars (27%), I'll still have 100 km range which covers my daily driving.  Of course, the Bolt will do much better.",

We see things so much clearer in hindsight: I just hope in the future, if we have suspicions, we ask, we get involved.\n\nThat still leaves the problem of church leadership that remains all words, and so little action.  Sacking a few bishops won't sink the church, nor will it really do all that much to change what's out there.  But it WILL send two messages.  The one is to those who are still tempted to look the other way.  Those in power cannot be allowed to look the other way, so sacking a few would be a good message to send.  But of even more importance, is the message that this would send to the laity: a laity that longs for a \"we hear you\" message.  Apologies without actions are corrosive.

They believed in free health care and guaranteed jobs. They confiscated inherited wealth and spent vast sums on public education. They purged the church from public policy, promoted a new form of pagan spirituality, and inserted the authority of the state into every nook and cranny of daily life. The Nazis declared war on smoking, supported abortion, euthanasia, and gun control. They loathed the free market, provided generous pensions for the elderly, and maintained a strict racial quota system in their universities—where campus speech codes were all the rage. The Nazis led the world in organic farming and alternative medicine. Hitler was a strict vegetarian, and Himmler was an animal rights activist.\"",

I agree with you that it should be possible to challenge orthodoxies, including globalization, and it's unhealthy to prevent such criticism in democracies, but surely there are good and bad ways to model and implement transnational and global institutions.

And yet we’re obsessed with Americans.  For many of us, our self-identity as a nation is simple: we’re not American. I don’t see how this kind of irrational anti-Americanism can square with our self-image as more erudite, more intelligent, etc. than Americans.

If it serves the Russia's purpose, they retweet it and amplify it and it later shows up in Breitbart and Fox News and the British rightwing rags.  I suspect that they aren't willing participants but are being used as pawns by the Russians; it is a symbiotic relationship.\n\nMost of what the Russians are using Lifesite News and Church Militant for is to smear Pope Francis.

I don't doubt many of the children get a quality education, but (at the end of the day) my tax dollars will be being used to prop up a school the purpose of which is to educate one religious group.

If the 1% benefits from the displacement of the human workforce then a greater share of the burden of supporting the needs of society as a whole will have to borne by those who are benefiting. In a utopian society this would free more people to pursue endeavours that are more soul fulfilling and geared towards enhancing the quality of life like arts and culture or to volunteering their time to meet the needs of society without the dependency on working for remuneration in order to survive. As I said utopian.",

Their symbolic actions have no affect on soldiers, veterans or the memory of those lying in American cemeteries at home or abroad. Nor does it harm their employers. By insisting that taxpayers provide them with facilities, the owners have little recourse when it comes to players protesting on that taxpayer funded property. Especially a protest as innocuous as taking a knee during the anthem. An action that probably would have passed into nothing of it's own accord by now if Trump hadn't started using it to divert attention away from the colossal failure his Presidency has become.

ALL assaults are a violation of an individual's physical and emotional well-being. For example, an unwanted slap on a woman's behind is a sexual assault. Is that a worse offence than slapping a man on the face? Which hurts more? Which is more demeaning?\n\nWomen are often victims of sexual assault. Feminists have drawn attention to that problem by claiming that it's a particularly pernicious form of assault. In doing so they've taken attention away from physical assault, which men experience at far higher rates than women.\n\nThe problem won't be fixed one gender at a time. No form of assault against anyone is acceptable, and all forms of assault must be condemned equally.",

And, yes, even a small nudge in rates would matter for these potential buyers and thus for the market as a whole.” Low Energy Stephen has found it easy to ignore pressure to use interest rates to cool housing prices because he has backed the dysfunctional measurement of owner-occupied housing costs in the target inflation indicator, which underestimates the impact of increasing house prices on inflation. Even the most trivial reform, like moving to the CPI ex mortgage interest as the target inflation indicator, would move the February 2017 inflation rate to 2.2%, above the 2% target rate.",

And of course there are thousands of tanker trips delivering refined products in or from Atlantic Canada because we refine about 6 times more oil than BC does -- around 420,000 bbl/day -- and export most of it to the US.\n\nAs for oil export, Newfoundland has 4 small ships that collect oil from the offshore with a combined capacity of 1 M bbl, ie, less than one ship per day takes oil to Wiffen Head, which can accommodate tankers up to Aframax size, ie,around 750,000 bbl, so about 2 or 3 oil tankers a week leave Newfoundland to ship crude oil to Irving and outside of Canada.",

Just as we have fixed prayers for corporeal worship we also have a fixed fast, if that makes any sense.\n\nThe spiritual aspect is there, but the focus when people come online is on trying to do things right, the same way someone praying the rosary for the first time might seek advice on practicalities rather than meditative aspect which are the real \"meat\" of the devotion. Likewise fasting itself is more of a frame, and the true \"meat\" from fasting comes once you go from how to why. \n\nThere is also the fact that nowadays there is little help to find in pastoral guidance when it comes to asceticism/mysticism in the west.

Federal Treasury Board says that total compensation in the public sector must equal total compensation in the private sector for similar jobs. Our military pension actuarial cost was 25.02% of salary. The public service 16.2%.That is money we did not get.\n\nThe gov't can attack the pension at any time. It did so in the mid 1980s, reducing indexing for two years.\n\nThe pensions are based on the average salary in the last 5 years of employment. For example 30 years work, a 60% pension The purchasing power of the pension is affected by inflation during the salary averaging years. . The purchasing power of people retiring this year with 60% pensions would be about 56% of average purchasing power in the 5 years. 1981 retirees, 44%.\n\nI understand from Treasury Board that this same method of averaging applies to all DB pensions",

Sure, but so does every government level. That's what they do. If you want to fix the MSB, run for office and fix it.",

It goes to show the continued privilege that Christians have over the rest of us. This same assembly ignored the pleas of a local vet that was not comfortable with the invocations. A moment of silence would make everyone except  Christian extremists happy.",
