                "2 cups all-purpose flour.    3/4 cup salt.    4 teaspoons cream of tartar.    2 cups lukewarm water.    2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil (coconut oil works too)    Food coloring, optional.    Quart sized bags.    Stir together the flour, salt and cream of tartar in a large pot. Next add the water and oil. If you\u2019re only making one color, add in the the color now as well. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Continue stirring until the dough has thickened and begins to form into a ball. Remove from heat and then place inside a gallon sized bag or onto wax paper. Allow to cool slightly and then knead until smooth. If you\u2019re adding colors after, divide the dough into balls (for how many colors you want) and then add the dough into the quart sized bags. Start with about 5 drops of color and add more to brighten it. Knead the dough, while inside the bag so it doesn\u2019t stain your hands. Once it\u2019s all mixed together you\u2019re ready to PLAY."
