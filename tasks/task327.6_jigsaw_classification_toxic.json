I remember being appalled and amazed my first time in Anchorage, back in 1992, that there was not a highway connection through downtown Anchorage even then.  \n\nIt's pathetic that with all the oil money of the 1970s and 1980s that this highway-to-highway project was not completed decades ago.  I mean, in a city of almost a third of a million people, it is beyond ludicrous to have a highway suddenly turn into downtown streets with innumerable traffic lights, as if Anchorage were some backwater pre-interstate highway Lower 48 small town.  But when it comes to traffic planning in Anchorage (more precisely, the lack and/or absurdity thereof), I am no longer shocked by incompetence and idiocy.",

Do the parties pay anything more than lip service to them in most cases? As you intimated, they are all about image,  little more than two quasi corporations profiteering, often from the same mega-corporate interests bankrollers. We ( non-elites )are not the parties, we're barely even equipment, useful only when it comes election time(what becomes more of a charade with each passing one). No, I don't see things changing for the better. As a nation, we seem to be getting dumber and more ugly by the day.",

It is a complete fool who purposely underestimates Russian intelligence and especially, their long game.  If Putin has demonstrated anything in Russia, it's how you play the right wing conservative traditionalist.  That's why he silences, imprisons, or kills his progressive critics with impunity.

My cousin applied for and was accepted for the Deaconate program in our diocese.  After about 3 months, he received a call from someone telling him he was rejected from the program.  They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.

Western petro dollars are the ultimate source of the billions SA is  spending to export Wahhbabism--it is building mosque everywhere, and supplying Saudi trained imams. ISIS actually uses Saudi textbooks to teach Islam on its territory. While Wahhabism itself may not preach terror, it is apparently a short step from that particular fundamentalism to cherry picking the Quran for verses in support of militant jihadims. \n\nAnd then there is Iran.

As I recall the reason for the 2nd wild card to was almost force the 2 wild card teams to use their ace in the wild card playoff game so they would go into the next series at a slight disadvantage.  When there was just 1 wild card team, that team often went far into the playoffs because they often had the momentum of playing competitive games through the end of the season while division winners typically rested players after clinching and lost their mojo. Examples- Rockies 2007 got to the WS. Angels 2002 won the WS. Those are the 2 that immediately came to mind but I remember MLB being concerned that wild cards were often advancing far.",

The population benefits from some handouts, and perhaps for that reason this population has developed very few real capabilities.\n\n\" Iran is a different kettle of fish; entirely. It is arguably a modern nation state, with a reasonably educated and capable population which has shown great resilience in adversity, and a political system that is nearest to that of a democratic state in the whole of Middle East.

Soon, six areas/people's in SE will be getting land and the settlement money they never got when everyone else did. They were \"looked over\". That land will not go to the tribes but to Corporations that will be set up for that purpose. (If it happens) \nNot all tribes or peoples had the same opportunity as the others but hopefully, will have learned from their mistakes and do much better at managing things for shareholders.",

In western Ukraine, the Ukrainian Catholic Church was mostly an exception to the rule, but that was because western Ukraine was ruled by the Poles, and the UCC mostly allied itself with the Ukrainians in their struggle against foreign domination.

Pick any country and then imagine that the voters in this country are conversant with what we are doing, and they all sit around the dinner table discussing what we are doing and how they are going to contact their political representative to get in step because Canada is showing the way. This is such a crock , and speaks more to a very special form of arrogance and a belief that what we do actually matters in the big global scheme of things. The truly sad part about all of this is a great many have bought into this absolutely false argument for a carbon tax.",

A reduced PFD is a future fact of life, as are income and sales taxes, and spending cuts.   To balance this latest action, Walker should veto the oil tax credits this year as well, like he did last year.    Then it's up to the legislature to cut spending and raise additional revenue.   Walker ' s plan is still the only credible way forward, but only if all measures are implemented  at the same time.

As heartbreaking as these situations might be, these kids are doing the drugs in secrecy, privately, and quietly in their parents homes. They are not doing it in the open. They are not leaving needles littered about the community. And they are not in a position where they can be open about their addiction such that they could take advantage of a safe injection house. Let's be honest about who would use these services and the people who would migrate from Seattle's green belts and derelect RVs to Issaquah. There is not a need for safe injection in Issaquah, but a need for drug education and prevention. I personally don't want to see what has happened to Seattle go on in our community.",

I'll bet that most of the dead and injured would much prefer that the shooter had been \"controlled\" before this atrocity.  I doubt they would trade the madman's right to killing machines for prayers, sympathy and a flag at half mast.  How much more horrific will the killing have to be?  No rules, just more death. That's the message I get. There is nothing respectful in creating the situations that lead to more and more horrific killing fields.

From what I can tell, most are doing well and almost all will graduating.  \n\nOne could ask why aren't these kids choosing UA system.  I suppose UA system can't meet everyone's needs.  I can also say that not everyone thinks that UA is that great of a University System.  \n\nIn our major population centers, our Alaskan kids have access to very solid education.  Of course, parents need to make sure they are involved and are making sure their children are making the most of what is offered.

Please media, do some real analysis vs. left wing's talking points. Let's look at just 6,\n\n1) Property Tax $10K max. Well, that's going to be approx $880K and higher home. In other words, you're not poor if you're paying $10K or more PT.\n2) Mortgage deduction < $500k (single), <$1 Million (married).   That's not the price of the house, it's your mortgage. If you have a mortgage higher than the above, then you're not poor.\n3) Simplifying the brackets. there's breaks in the middle ranges positive to those folks and smaller changes on the edges. People between $45K & $200K get the biggest benefits. \n4) Drop of the AMT. This does benefit the $150K to $1million. Helps those listed.\n5) Child tax credit. A joke at $1K upped to another joke of $1600. Hopefully this will be increased.\n6) Double deductions - 6K to 12K or married 12K to 24K. Lowers your taxable income. \n\nHigher Income Pays+",

The reality of Cuba is that Castro's failed socialist schemes, even more than Trudeau 1.0's failed socialist schemes of the 1970s and early 80s, resulted in Cubans taking a serious hit to their standard of living.  The country went from second richest in Latin America to second poorest (beating out Haiti) during Castro's half century dictatorship.  Even his early reforms in health care and education have largely run out of money and deteriorated drastically.  But the biggest three things Fidel did really badly for the average Cuban were breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Mind you, Cassie, not all Cubans suffered.  Fidel, for example, took them for some $900 million dollars, 20 mansions around the Caribbean and an 88 foot luxury yacht to die for.

The Gnostics actually taught that the Hebrew God Yahweh was an evil lesser god, and the material created world evil or flawed. Gnostics were the \"anti-Christs\" Paul and John were talking about.\n\nAdventism is the most anti-Gnostic denomination today.

I am therefore going to have less to invest in personal investments and will make less money on this capital.

Different kinds of targets respond differently, some to P wave, others to Q wave. Exposed human beings for example, composed mostly as they are with water, are very soft P wave responders, thus easily splashed at quite some distance from ground zero. Hardened underground targets (e.g. missile silos) are, by way of contrast, much more resistant to blast overpressures, hence a kill requires much greater warhead delivery vehicle accuracy - - aka a much smaller circular error probable.\n\n// more to follow //",

We could have just drawn them down by drilling through their base and letting the water escapeI know there were lots of reasons to take the dams down but it seems few people in authority thought about reasons to not take them down.  Given what we lost it does seem we could have kept the dams and provided access to the upper Elwha for fish.

It is true that in its early stages of development, stem cell therapy currently carries  a lot of risk so it is likely not worth the risk for some patients, but this therapy will likely become safer over time and/or give rise to other new therapies.\n\nAnd MS isn't really treatable at all.

It was impossible to provide for them all. I placed the unwanted kittens in a gunny sack containing a stone, tied up the sack, and placed it in a pond so that the kittens would drown. It was a painless death. In another case, to avoid offspring, I shot and killed our mother cat. Often such methods prevent unnecessary suffering of animals. I also shoot and kill porcupines whenever I can. When our dogs go after them, the porcupines slap their tails at the dogs, and the dogs come home with hurtful quills. When we pull out these quills, the dogs suffer considerable pain. Mercy killing is often the best solution to save animals from pain.",

Or significant work to retrofit. In a typical house, your furnace and A/C, major appliances, TVs, lights, garage door opener, sump pump, power tools, kitchen tools, etc etc would all need to be replaced or retrofitted.

Much easier are the things that have an external transformer (cell phones, laptop, etc) where you'd only have to replace the transformer.  \n\nIn the long run, conversion to DC may make sense, but the transition would present huge problems.

Every time I hear or read someone say Jesus was socialist, I shudder that people do not understand what socialism even is, and clamor for socialism in the same sentence they complain about the government. Albert Einstein may have claimed to be a socialist, but he also fled the only socialist country he ever lived in. Socialism = full government control of production and capital. Everything else is negotiable (such as Nazi racism). Liberalism = autonomy, free markets, rule of law; else negotiable. 99% of conservatives are still liberals in the broader definition of the word (though DT threatens that).

Even then, this does not fix everything. \n\nThe restorative justice model that some of these advocates are pushing is probably off the mark. Restorative justice is an Indigenous justice model based on the theory that everything in creation is intertwined and if there is an offender in our midst, everyone will be negatively affected unless we can persuade this individual to make amends. In return, we do everything to bring him back into the circle. I would venture to say that this model is inapplicable to a certain class of sexual offender and that when Jennifer Haselberger called these events an exercise in \"self-delusion,\" she was right.",

At the time, he defended the guest worker practice by saying it was common among US companies, who will bring in 119,000 temporary workers in 2016 and 2017, many to work seasonal jobs. Temporary foreign workers come into the country under the H-2B visa program.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reports that the latest documents released by the labor department—which will now be put in the position of approving future requests by the US president to hire guest workers—show that Trump cut wages for some of these employees.\"",

Mostly they were enclosed in the house, defenceless in court – profoundly marginalised. (Rabbis prayed ‘I thank thee Yahweh, thou hast not made me a dog, a Samaritan or a woman’).  Jesus never warns men about seductive women but about their own lust. Women are his friends: Mary from Magdala, Martha and Mary from Bethany, a sick syro-phoenician woman, despised prostitutes, faithful followers like Salome. They were not called disciples because the Aramaic word was always a masculine noun.\nThe women loved Jesus and remained faithful and were the first to witness and report on the resurrenction.

Plus many of the big ticket item shops are locally-owned.  \n\nThose local stores are going to be crushed by Walker's move because they have to order their expensive inventory months in advance and had good reason to account on the PFD being two grand.  Now they are stuck with that inventory but it's not unreasonable to expect that their  sales will be at least half of what they projected.  I do not disagree with Walker that something had to be done, but the reserve accounts would have help for at least another year.

They recognised the importance of free expression, and also of keeping the peace. \n\nSo if you dress up in riot gear, head over to a rally with your pals similarly kitted out, knowing that there's going to be trouble, and if you then charge a bunch of people with the intent of seriously injuring them simply because they subscribe to ideas that you personally hate, who are the villains? The people you hate because you say they're hateful? Or the violent thugs?\n\nThe whole idea of the West, the entire concept of democracy, is to live and let live. This is tolerance.

If there were absolute anarchy, no one could make a living. If there were no roads and bridges ... ETC.\n\n2. Government regulations cost money, but they also save money in other instances. What if we all had to purchase lab equipment to check the milk we buy? What would it cost us?\n\n3. More taxes do not necessarily mean less money in your pocket. See #2 above. To see only the cost of taxes is an unbalanced, unreal view of things.

There is no ethical dilemma in this scenario, companies manufacture different products for different countries everyday that essentially do the same thing, there are just different regional considerations.  Canadians get a five year warranty because they pay for it, not because of an ethical short coming.  \nWith further research you may also find that Americans are unwilling to pay a higher price for a product with a longer warranty.  They may be more likely to save money up front and take their chances later, no amount of government regulation can change that kind of fundamental difference.  \nProduct warranties on coffee makers would fall under the economic umbrella of a business, not as an ethical concern.

I had the opportunity to hear him speak at a Theology Conference in Chicago a few years ago, and more recently when he spoke at a Woman's Conference in Rome.  I seem to remember him saying that he has 22 siblings, since his father had many wives.  It is so refreshing that he has a wholistic view of life, which he got from his deeply African culture.  I hope the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church are listening.  It is really difficult for those indoctrinated with the Adam and Eve story, where woman is an accessory to a man from the beginning, to unlearn that myth and see the wholeness of God's Redemptive Plan, by accepting the more likely scenario as also found in the Book of Genesis, where God created woman and man at the same time and as EQUALS IN GOD'S IMAGE!  God's Plan has been frustrated from the beginning, probably partly because of cultural issues, in my view.\nSincerely,  Dr Rosemary Eileen McHugh, MD, MSpir",

I employ 4 people. The decisions I make allow these employees to feed their families, have a roof over their heads, and go out to dinner when they want to, so in effect for this income, my decisions support about 15 people.\n Due to our income, and age the cheapest plan available last open enrollment for my wife and I was $3800.00 per month (no kidding). \n\nto be continued",
