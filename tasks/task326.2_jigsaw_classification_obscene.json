More info about vaccines to stop pandemic illnesses- I'm allergic to vxns, so more education helps me stay healthy. A lecture about working together in extreme conditions, appropriate these days. Maybe the December lecture can have someone from our military science community discuss their role with NASA, the Army Corp of Engineers, etc. Then after that, maybe an EPA government scientist, a National Parks Service scientist. No matter where you get the scientist, they're fact based. They use peer review, data, and research to support their claims.

Sometimes the relationship dies and the hierarchy needs to recognize that.  But that death is a long process--it can be that the two spouses have grown emotionally in different directions, or that one has grown and the other has not; it can be due to a lack of communication skills where when differences arise and they fight, they don't know how to reconcile or other.  Each marriage is different just as each individual is different.  If Catholic priests were married they would have experienced this themselves and would understand it.

I hope you will take the time to read our materials.  Speak Out Seattle is opposed to drug consumption sites, known in King County as CHELs or safe consumption sites.  We are reaching out to candidates across King County to ask them to become familiar with the issues from the anti-perspective.  The Cities of King County have a right to vote against drug consumption sites in their city.  This has already occurred in Renton and will be discussed in City Council in early August in Bellevue.

They may simply have decided that they were losing their shirts in a particular territory or for a particular class of drivers and decided they really didn't want to insure that group any more - the obvious solution - increase premiums for those drivers to the point that they go to another company.

First, interim HART executive director Murthy stated that an at-grade system was considered and rejected as not viable because the city wanted a fully automated system. Mayor Caldwell then added that the city was committed to an elevated system. Neither of those gentlemen mentioned maglev, which would be both fully automated and elevated. The mayor has already indicated that the $8+ billion will not be enough to finish 20 miles, but it would be more than enough for maglev to not only complete the project but also extend it to meet the locally preferred alternative for alignment extensions both east and west.",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

It is shocking for me to have to admit that the pope and bishops are still ignoring the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children. All I can conclude is that Gretchen does not realize the shame and shock that victims have experienced from clergy that have no conscience about their own crimes against children and vulnerable adults.

And in both parties it came after they promised to do politics differently.\n\nNo wonder con artists like the Trumpster and O'Leery are able to sweep up voters and win political contests. The disillusionment with politicos can only be reinforced by actions like this. Justin Trudeau should be ashamed. But, like Harper was, he is immune from shame where personal power and politics are king.",

Robert Byrd was a Democrat Senator from West Virginia up until  2010. He was also a member of the KKK and even created his very own 'Klan' chapter.\n.\nI'm glad to see some Democrats finally coming around to facing their embarrassing past and joining the party of Lincoln in denouncing racism and bigotry and working with our President to fix a broken system.",

The polytheistic model was rife with \"levels,\" within the gods, to the civil leaders (often seen as lesser gods), to any number of social layers. There's no shortage of allusions to this in the gospels (Jesus \"dared\" to eat with a tax collector, or a prostitute, or touch a leper?) So I'm not surprised that there are echoes of that in the early church. What IS saddening, is that church leadership still clings to that.\n\nUltimately, so much of what we're seeing in our own society today is a rebellion against the echoes of that within our society (racism, sexism, elitism, etc...)

They can do this again and it will make the players tougher and harder to beat.

Now, we do not know what other deals were offered, nor do we know all the facts about the HOOPP deal, but there are only two possible reasons it got done.\n\nFirst, management at HC is poor and did not shop around, did not see the signalling of the deal and just went along with it.  (It may also be the case that the HOOPP team were too aggressive and that they tipped the boat by mistake.) This is not impossible to believe for a firm whose funding model was 84% retail without any lines of credit and other.\n\nSecond, management knows their die is cast and are just trying to slow the bleeding and provide time for an orderly wind down.\n\nEither way, HC is not an entity that can write GICs.",

Still, to the chagrin of my peers, I never let them point toy guns (or even their fingers) at a human and say \"POW!\" No squirt gun fights, playing 'Army', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Cowboys and Indians' or Grand Theft Auto type video games (These came out later and as \"adults\" they played them anyway...). And I screened (to the best of my ability) their intake of movies and TV. Perhaps I was viewed as a hard ass, but, I know first hand that it sucks to be shot. Yet, guns have always been an important tool in my life and I'm not one to throw out a hammer over a black thumbnail. I've kept them handy and I've kept them loaded. If you haven't taken the time to discipline your children before getting a gun, maybe you should get a baseball bat instead.",

Although I personally am a believer in RRSPs, I also understand the math involved.  If she is in a much higher tax bracket when she draws the money out (likely because it would make sense for him to 'pension split' with her) then she is better off to invest the money in a TFSA or non-registered account.  Do save the money, just do the math before putting it in a RRSP to make sure it makes sense, otherwise TFSA or non-registered account.",

The cancer risk associated with substances or agents assigned the same classification may be very different, depending on factors such as the type and extent of exposure and the strength of the effect of the agent.\"\nIARC is limited to assessing hazard only by their own rules.

These statues were mass produced during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights eras in attempts to suppress progress.\nThe very idea of the \"state's rights\" argument that is so often cited by supporters of these statues is a fallacy that was perpetuated at the end of the war to promote reconciliation between the North and South during Reconstruction.\nFurther evidence is that General James Longstreet who post-war was pro-reconciliation and black-supporting is not represented with statues. The lack of statues for a pro-reconciliation general shows that the statues were motivated by political goals, not historic preservation.",

This is something that has happened about a million times in the past; is it happening now?\n\nThe way that unions traditionally deal with an economy with a labor shortage--such as we have now with unemployment under 5%--is by bargaining for higher wages and a greater share of the profits, which would make sense now because wages have essentially been flat for 30+ years despite rising productivity and growth in upper class wealth.\n\nConservatives, however, have had terrific success busting unions. Unions organize everyone, immigrant and native born alike and union wages would do away with the incentive to hire illegal immigrants, who get the lowest wage of all. The GOP leadership want to APPEAR to cater to blue collar anger at illegal immigrants, but, in the end, they will listen to Wall Street, the CEO's and their donors, who love low wages.",

Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back', and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.\n\nWHAT A DICK.\n\nhappy leap year",

The richer a man was, the more wives he could afford.\n\nThe Greeks' strong democratic principles and desire for equality among citizens made them reject polygamy in favor of monogamy. The Romans admired Greek culture and adopted Greek monogamy. The western world inherited monogamy from the Romans, not the Bible.\n\nIt goes hand in hand with a more egalitarian social system.

This is where Roe v. Wade went off the tracks. I hate to concede it, but I must: New York, California, Ohio, whatever---all have the right to say that abortion is always just fine! As an American, I accept that that's the democratic process. By the same token, it can go the other way, too---and the Roe Court had to turn legal pretzels (and do lasting damage to constitutional law far beyond the scope of abortion) in order to reach the conclusion it did.

First, interim HART executive director Murthy stated that an at-grade system was considered and rejected as not viable because the city wanted a fully automated system. Mayor Caldwell then added that the city was committed to an elevated system. Neither of those gentlemen mentioned maglev, which would be both fully automated and elevated. The mayor has already indicated that the $8+ billion will not be enough to finish 20 miles, but it would be more than enough for maglev to not only complete the project but also extend it to meet the locally preferred alternative for alignment extensions both east and west.",

The excise tax surcharge produces steady, slow-growing revenue that falls short of construction costs during much of the construction period, but continues on after construction ends. So paying for rail with the excise tax surcharge requires lots of short-term borrowing, which adds interest expense, which bumps up the total project cost to around $10 billion. A hotel room tax increase could generate more revenue faster, decreasing borrowing and lowering interest expense.\n\nThe legislature's indecision on a revenue source is what's moving the numbers around, yet Saiki blames the City.

Most wood stoves are too big to run wide open all the time, and they'd also sublimate faster, the walls should be as thick as possible.\nIn the USA, I built a house with a masonry, air-tight wood stove, by simply adding airtight doors to the firebox, of a normal, 35' high chimney.  The firebox was surrounded with 30 or 40 tons of thermal mass.  That allows you to only burn the appliance at it's hottest setting, for as long as it takes to warm up the masonry, which then keeps the house warm, until the next day.

But that's not surprising, as the government understands that healthy educated workers are  happier and more productive.  \nGiven that, however, I'd say that most Americans would find the repressive aspects of the   system unbearable and would prefer an education that does not prepare kids for a dictatorship.    Mandrapa's column reads like a Cuban government handout, which is not surprising given that he was an  apologist for Serbia's Milosevic during his war on Kosovo.\nMy hope for Cuba is that once they free themselves from Communism they can preserve some of the good  qualities of their social welfare system without slipping back to its former social backwardness or ending up like the poor former Communist states of Eastern Europe.",

As soon as he left office, the seas rose! Howz dat cuz?! He also got Holder to squash an investigation into the murder of border patrol agent Terry. He allowed the weaponization of the IRS to intimidate and suppress law abiding citizens rights. He allowed Iran & DPRK to get closer to having nuclear weapons, while at the same time getting rid of ours.

That means lower base rates but fewer (ideally NO) deductions/breaks/credits.  \n\nPersonally I's shrink corporate income taxation significantly (that just passes through to consumers anyway in the form of higher prices, and makes US business less competitive), lower individual income taxation modestly, and add a national sales tax of 3-5%.  Sales taxes are one of the best ways to make sure everyone pays a fair share, and it's far harder to \"tax break\" your way out of it.

One can only asses others on message boards by the contents of their posts. Your posts are indicative of an RWA personality. http://www.wow.com/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarianism \n\nThe defensive tone of your response is interesting. It seems to indicates a negative connotation of RWA personality types. Indeed, most view the traits associated with RWA as distasteful. The conventionalism trait in RWAs causes them to agree with the popular sentiment. The RWA will then reject the idea that they themselves are that personality type which is of course, cognitive dissonance. \n\nGood luck with that.",

They are-- anyone who's put cash down, refundable or not, is a much stronger lead than someone who merely signs up for a test drive. Yes, we still have to build a compelling product, and continue to communicate that product to our pre-order customers. While some will certainly fall off, to me it seems likely they will more than be made up for from folks who are unwilling to place a preorder on something that is not yet in production, which is a very common refrain we hear.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the positive home-town encouragement.

As for all the hatchery critics out there, understand that I don't disagree with some of the negative consequences that have come out of hatcheries in the past.

But you also have to look at the other side of the coin, up until the HSRG review, very few hatcheries made any attempt at removing excess hatchery fish, and continued to use broodstock that wasn't locally adapted. This caused immeasurable genetic changes to the wild spawning population. We can't go back and change what has happened, we can only do better, and try to limit the effects of hatchery impacts to wild stocks. That being said, in the case of the Elwa, there really isn't a wild stock to mine eggs or broodstock from, at least not in numbers that are sustainable. using the hatchery, as a tool, for rebuilding a locally adapted broodstock is the only answer.",

I see many comments on this section seem to disagree with the entire idea of combating this disturbing trend, and suggesting that any interference by the government is itself contrary to principles underlying free speech and free expression.  Please note that this government - yes the Liberal government - is already bringing the federal govt's power to bear on this - for the worse, mind you.  Recently, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada refused a grant application from the renowned UofT professor Jordan Peterson, in what can only be construed as retaliation and an attempt to silence his views on the issue of gender pronouns. What is that, other than using the federal govt's power to weigh against free speech and free expression?",

If you make too much noise the chiefs will disenroll you.

But salaries were frozen until performance and years of service moved an employee up within their new, lower grade.  All of this was announced and implemented in a matter of a few months.  People weren't happy.  Some left the company because the career advancements achieved so far disappeared.  They found jobs elsewhere.  But most stayed.  And a year later, the new organization was functioning well and people had adjusted to a new reality.  Most were content to still be in Alaska doing jobs they loved.

To jeopardize the equity current home owners have is wrong and could spell disaster moving forward as many are relying on this equity to finance their retirement.

At some point there's got to be a reckoning. \n\nThank you Russell.",

We slaughtered hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, children, and even, dear Harry, fetuses, since Rethuglicans care more about the unborn than the born. Truman must have known American POWs would die in his attacks as well.  That, to him, was \"worth it\" if the Russians could be scared off.

Your response regarding education and heath care, moreover, raises difficult questions. I guess we don't follow the American examples of privatizing education to a lesser extent,and health care to a much greater, is because both are pregnant with value judgement. While one could argue that an egalitarian approach toward education funding is somewhat misguided, I think our aversion toward following the American model of health care is well founded with reference to cost.

And it authorized the \"individual\" to possess the same firearms as soldiers and the militia.   For the record, the US Supreme Court held in 1876 that the 2nd Amendment did not refer only to a \"well regulated militia\" but also to  individual citizens.  See United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, (1876).  See also Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886).

The revolution in Hawaii was the same, a pre-emptive declaration of war due to the citizens of the US 'threatened' by the Native Hawaiian people. This declaration of war was not by the US government, it was by a small group of conspirators living in Hawaii. The conspirators that declared war committed treason by claiming they were representing the US government. In war, the \"law\" is decided by the winner. Liliuokalani signed an abdication, the Kingdom was dissolved. In July 1894, the Republic of Hawaii was established and the Kingdom of Hawaii ceased to exist.

You have to imagine some horrible censorship, because otherwise you'd have to admit no one who is actually educated OR responsible takes your position.",

We are also fortunate in that our form of government allows us to participate, which we should do as best we can by following God's word. Kristoff is overall a good man who helps others. But he twists the words of Jesus to fit his political views and wants us to follow him. That is a dangerous thing to do, for both him and us. Compassion and aid should be a part of our national character, which can only happen through our personal character. Delegating that to an impersonal government which necessarily will use it for political purposes is not the way to accomplish that.",

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

It argues for allowing opinion, even on a hot topic.   (Especially on a hot topic, I'd say.)  \"Cultural appropriation: Why can't we debate it?\" she asks.  Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?  Then why did they lose their jobs over being part of a debate?  I support Renzetti's take on this.\n\nPart Two: The Thorny Question\n\nWhat do you think of Shakespeare's Richard III,  Orwell's 1984, and Twain's Huckleberry Finn?

BHP is an Australian stock with a beta to that market, a beta to iron ore and metal prices and therefore to world GDP.  We do not know how Singer is sizing up those risks and hedging them with other metals stock, Australian stocks or commodity futures. \n\nFinally, we won't know if and when he exits based on success or failure of his activist effort.

Racism is not just a feeling, it is a real system that people had to live under in other countries where they were limited. Canada does not have a lot of it, most actual racism in this country revolved around first nations. Not immigrants of colour who chose to come here voluntarily and experience a better life. In South Africa the black majority was ruled by white minority without ability to vote. That's racism: a minority was telling the majority colour how to live.

The logic here is if you are going to attack the PM, then first make sure you are not guilty of the same thing. Since the rules are not about the yacht , but how you got there, then you are fine.

During those decades, the Gini index was in the high 30's which would put us in the neighborhood of modern Japan, but not as equitable as the Scandinavian countries, many of which are in the 20's.  See: https://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/usa/\n\nUBI, which might or might not be the best way to lower income inequality, would bring the Gini index down a bit, especially if it was funded by raising the top bracket income tax rate, or by eliminating tax loopholes used by wealthy families.  \n\nNear the middle of the period I'm talking about, in 1960 during the Republican Eisenhower administration, the top bracket income tax rate was around 90%",

The single line from Dave's Cr to Anchorage is stability limited to 75 MW, therefore it's unlikely that that line can support both Bradley and a new plant at Snow River.  So the cost of the plant will need about $150 - $$200M, kaching!!, for an additional line and substation because it's unlikely the existing one can be reconductored to 230 kV. Snow River hydro is not going to be built anytime soon, if ever, because although the rated capacity is 75 MW, the capacity factor is going to be maybe 45%, so it's hard to envision financing a $750M+  project that wouldn't even supply half the average load on the Kenai Peninsula.
