    "Definition": "You will be given two dialogue options. Each conversation will contain an element of emotion. Emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and others are all possible. Consider whether they have a common emotion and answer 'yes' if they do. If not, return 'no'.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'I hate people who don't take any responsibility'. Dialogue 2: 'I love Pheonix'.",
            "output": "no",
            "explanation": "Since the first dialogue displays anger and the second dialogue displays happiness, they don't share the same emotion and the output is 'no'."
        },
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'Thank you for the pencil'. Dialogue 2: 'Take the next right to go to ASU'.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "Both dialogues are 'other' emotions since they aren't happy, sad, or angry. Therefore, the answer is 'yes': both are 'other' emotions."
        },
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'I am dejected because my dog died'. Dialogue 2: 'I am feeling low because ASU lost to stanford today'",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "Here, both dialogues display a sad emotion. So, yes, both dialogues display a sad emotion."
        }
    ],
    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'I am going to school'. Dialogue 2: 'My friend pissed off me with his jokes'.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "In the first dialog, there is no happy, sad, or angry emotion, so it is an 'other' emotion. In the second dialogue, there is anger, so the output should be 'no' because the emotions are not matched. This is a bad example."
        },
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'I am gowtam, I am '. Dialogue 2: 'I am going for a walk today'.",
            "output": "no",
            "explanation": "Because neither of the dialogues are happy, sad, or angry, the answer is 'yes' for both of them. Therefore, this is a poor example."
