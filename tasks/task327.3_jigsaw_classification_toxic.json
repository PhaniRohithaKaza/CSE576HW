It goes to the student / parent, directly. Can't one say then they are funding the student ? Then once the check is cashed the funds are brought to the school , indirectly. A roommate of  a friend bragged about cashing his checks, not going to school and drinking up the money. He than went to jail ( not for this ) and a $1800.00  check came for him.

Wall tried to close library service in rural areas but only changed position when there was a huge outcry. The Provincial Bus Company could have been saved for something like less than a million dollars. Drug prices paid by seniors on limited incomes have skyrocketed. \n\nAnd likely the worst thing, during the years when Saskatchewan's commodity prices were sky high...generally covering the the period of Walls government, Premier Wall did not use the extra money to help pay down the debt, or put anything into a rainy day fund, which is really ridiculous for anyone who knows anything about commodity prices. \n\nBut his governments unwillingness to do anything about global warming...are neglect of a criminal level.",

Francis continues to use the same language of sin, mercy, and salvation that effectively trivializes our relationships with God and one another. Granted, he is an advocate for mercy, but that mercy is for people who have made mistakes anyone could make, for people who have been victimized by violent spouses, and so on. Mistakes aren't sins and we don't need salvation from them, but we keep mumbling about sin and salvation as if that's the only way to understand our relationship with God. \nI prefer to think that God raises up people to help us make course corrections, not to judge and condemn us if we don't get it right. I suspect Francis is inclined to think in those terms as well, but as long as he keeps speaking about us as sinners, I think he's just putting cheese on a donkey's -- well, I guess it sounds better in Italian. - Monica.",

The deafening, disgraceful silence from Trump's so-called \"evangelical\" advisors to his abhorrent statements on Charlottesville and their refusal to resign in protest is a testament to their \"evangelical\" allegiance to some other god than mine. The religion they're \"evangelizing\" by standing by Trump and his false equivalence of bigoted racist xenophobic neo-nazi thugs with largely peaceful counter-protesters bears no resemblance to the Jesus I know from the Gospels. Clergy of any stripe will ultimately be held accountable by God if they let this moment pass and fail to decide where they stand. They should remember what happened to St. Peter when he failed the test - three times.",

There are about 55,000 illegal aliens here in Denver out of a population of 700,000 according to Pew. Getting rid of them will reduce school overcrowding, increase the availability of affordable housing, improve the outrageous traffic situation and reduce the indigent burden on Denver Health. Sounds like a politicians dream, right? But since our city is run by politicians from the looney left, rewarding foreign lawbreakers is more important than the interests of the citizens of Denver.",

Also the points raised by the CDF concerning AL were ignored, so it had no input at all in AL, it was deliberately excluded.\nIt is said that Müller realised this but stayed on hoping he could do more good in office than out of it. Alas, it was to no avail, like Cdl Burke he was unceremoniously dumped and his deputy promoted; no doubt a bitter pill to swallow in private.\nIn trying to not gainsay the Pope whose official voice he was and at the same time trying to uphold Catholic teaching, he walked a tightrope by attacking the 'dubia' Cdls whilst at the same time agreeing with them.

They may be playing 3D chess here.\nTheir real long term concern is uncontrolled state subsidized players, China's COMAC and Russia's UAC, who have introduced a 737/A320 competitor. By contrast Airbus is a known manageable competitor subject to some constraints through international trade bodies.\nAirbus has no more incentive than Boeing at letting COMAC and UAC get their hands on state of the art technology in the C-series. Airbus already has the A320 at the upper end of the commuter aircraft market, they won't let the C-series move upmarket. If the Chinese or Russians had gotten it, they would have moved upmarket selling these versions at real fire sale prices.\nFinally, Boeing never had interest in the low margin lower end of the commuter market. They can let Airbus duke it out with their partner Embraer. Leaving Boeing to focus on the much higher margin MoM 797 program.",

And, in office, Jackson displayed a deep grasp of the Constitution and a determination to defend it against the growing possibility of secession.\n\nNone of this, of course, is true of Trump, who never served in the armed forces, never served in (or even ran for) public office, and apparently doesn't even pay income taxes.

One may find support in that, for the view that the soul comes at conception, but it falls well short of making that assertion. It's an argument from moral caution, rather than certainty.\n\nFrom the EPE:\n\"Pope Pius IX challenged the canonical tradition about the beginning of ensouled life set by Pope Gregory XIV in 1591. He believed that while it may not be known when ensoulment occurs, there was the possibility that it happens at conception. Believing it was morally safer to follow this conclusion, he thought all life should be protected from the start of conception. \" \n\nI know it's hard to believe, but one line of the Church's argument rests, in significant part, on moral caution, rather than material certainty. Another rests on equivalence -- that to kill the thing at point A is morally the same as doing so at point C or Z",

And if he did, he could beat her for bringing shame to the family name.  Most women had to resort to prostitution to survive.  Jesus was very much aware of this.\nToday, women have much more to say about divorce---but that still doesn't eradicate the heart-ache, and mental distress many people endure.

Also keep in mind many, many teen suicides do not make the news. There's one from this week that is nearby, outside LPS, but unmentioned. A girl who sat next to my son in class committed suicide 3 years ago, and it was told to the students, but there was no press.

But if you want to make it last — and you don't have 60 votes in the Senate — then you need to find a way to pay for it (or at least look like you did). Taking health insurance away from poor and sick people would have done just that for the Obamacare taxes, which primarily hit people in the top 1 or 2 percent. Indeed, as you can see below in the chart from the Urban Institute, the combination of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the poor that was the GOP health-care plan would have been a reverse Robin Hood that redistributed income from people making $50,000 or less to those making $200,000 or more.\"",

These ‘core failings’ could be characterized as antipathy and disdain for the … presumption of innocence and by parity of reasoning, those judges could be removed from the bench on the basis of animus. Yet most are not subject to discipline, let alone removal. Their errors are dealt with on appeal.”\n\nIf anywhere near true then the Canadian justice system has some serious problems and the impact on public confidence in the system needs to be addressed.",

Under the 280E about 80% of the normal deductions a business can take are not allowed resulting in an extremely higher taxable income.

Boys depressed in childhood had a high likelihood of ending up in jail. Another risk factor was punitive parenting.\n\nIf you start from the premise that there is an overlap between being a cop and being a criminal (they are often cut from the same cloth)(\"every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints\") perhaps universal quality child care (early learning and development) could be a long term strategy for preventing the kind of hyper-masculinity and the enabling code of silence which is making police culture toxic if it reduces risk factors in boys and teaches openness towards alternative problem solving techniques.\n\nThe cost savings here could be huge if you consider the Perry Preschool findings: of a total public benefit of $195K, the crime savings amounted to $171K.",

What an omission for a Congregation which likes to think it is the very centre of power.\nYou are right on the 'censorship' front.\nSo far as Muller keeping his job:- His imminent departure from it has been touted for what seems like very many months. But here Muller still is. So perhaps Francis is happy to keep Muller in place at the CDF, confident that Muller can't (or won't) do or say anything very much? Perhaps it is Muller who has been censored?",

There are a number of new higher wage jobs, but we also have new people (some of them working people) moving into the area again.   Housing and rent costs have shot way up, so no wonder it is harder to make ends meet:  harder to find a decent paying job and the cost of living has gone up.    \n\nThese graphs show where the jobs are clustering:  at the top, and the bottom.

The LDCs buy almost nothing from Canada and the trade relationship is completely one sided. \nChina has a very real incentive to sign a free trade agreement with Canada in order to get back some of the billions of dollars of exports which they have lost. In addition, China is our largest potential market for energy, lumber, agricultural products and minerals which are our main exports. \nThe timing is good - if we can negotiate a decent deal.",

In this case, Crouch has not yet been convicted of any crime and the investigation is ongoing, so punitive actions such as termination or suspension without pay would be premature.

Fortunately, time softened my hard heart for what that means, and I have quantified his statement, and it's most interesting.\nFor ALL WA state teachers to be paid the same scale as Everett SD teachers are paid (contract on EEA website), there would need be an additional $750,000,000 collected of WA state taxpayers. This would be \"about\" a 10% increase to the payroll for Certificated employees in the state (12,000 more employees than teachers only).\nSo, one wonders why it needs be $2,000,000,000 of an increase to the entire budget for a solution which seemingly would solve all issues related to teacher pay in WA state.\nBut, then, many hands are in the till, no?",

The gifts stood on a precariously fragile looking table placed between the first row of pews. But it wasn't gold or crystal. The wine was in an ordinary glass cruet, the small hosts in a rather ancient and not particularly shiny ciborium. The cloth covering the table was blazing white and starched well enough to probably support the whole building. And this little congregation of people attending, at the end of the long day, attended to the simple ritual and words of a weekday Mass--nourished after the day's journey, refreshed from our thirst, unwinding in a small and familiar company of saints (in the best sense of that word) while beyond the heavy doors the world still rumbled by.",

Barriers to internal trade have been a problem that has prevented Canada, amongst other things, from being a real country. Every PM since Confederation has tried to solve this and until now no one has. This decision is almost as important as repatriating the Constitution and Trudeau has done well to accomplish it. Now, to really grow up and take our place on the world stage as a truly sovereign nation, all we have to do is learn to defend ourselves and to come up with an emending formula for the constitution",

So what label should we place on you Linda? You people who are so willing to shred the level of discussion to the lowest level possible in a Town of 1000. Why? Because you came down on the losing side to the Sanctuary City Issue? Pathetic.  And just so you know, yeah Linda, most of us know that Robin is the wife of the Mayor and we like iT.",

This cost does not include the extensions to West Kapolei and UH-Manoa, estimated in 2012 to cost $ 2.5 Billion and $1. 4 B respectively (total cost of $3.9 billion.). The impact on traffic congestion?  According to the City's EIS, traffic will grow by 23% in 2030, with rail traffic will grow by 21% plus, a \"reduction\" of roughly only 1.4%. Former DTS director Wayne Yoshioka conceded that \"traffic congestion with rail in 2030 will be worse than it is without rail today\".  In its ROD, FTA admits traffic congestion will not be reduced but that rail is needed as an alternative for those who do not own cars. A According to the 2003 EIS, the preferred alternative was bus rapid transit, not light rail at grade nor elevated rail which it dismissed as too costly and unsightly.  In 2004 Mufi decided to build the \"too costly and unsightly\" elevated heavy rail.",

That has been investigated and found false, and the data has been published.  I believe Trump's claims of voter fraud are part of his  distraction plan.  He can't seem to accept that fact he is president, which is a bit odd, but his ego needs to think everyone loves him.  He is using 'voter fraud' to distract from the Russian hackers and the possibility they helped him win.",

I've seen it climbing up and pulling down wild rose and mooseberry plants, and I shudder to think what our woods and roadsides are going to look like in another ten or twenty years if this bird vetch cannot be controlled (which it almost certainly cannot be at this point).",

Interstate 90 is already overtaxed, and trying to haul all the region's air freight over Snoqualmie Pass in the winter is a physical impossibility without punching a 12 lane tunnel through the pass.  But expanding air freight to Paine Field might help, although they also have their contingent of NIMBYS  that will fight expansion of their airport. #2 is also not feasible.  The airport is already close to capacity.  Since the issue seems to be noise during sleeping hours, maybe getting the Port to install more upgraded window and insulation in homes affected by airport noise would help.  More could be done for noise abatement, but since Federal Way is just six miles south of the airport directly in line with all three runways it will never be as quiet as the north end or the east side.",

By making those plays you back 8 out of the box and allow for a few holes in the run game, which helps the pass game even more(It also helps the defense stay off the field longer). That’s why a great QB can still have success behind a bad O-line. All three of our QB’s are awful because their decision making is atrocious and they don’t hit those plays consistently when they are. Trevor did do that in our first few games, which is why we looked better on offense. However his decision making since has been awful and that is why he got benched and will be cut(or traded) after the season. Same will happen to the other two,",

In 1980, in Arkansas, a Titan missile in a silo exploded as a result of a liquid fuel leak, which blew the 740 ton silo lid off and catapulted the 2nd stage and warhead into the air. The second stage then blew up and the 9 Megaton warhead was thrown 100 feet away from the entrance to the facility. The designed in safety systems worked and the warhead did not detonate and no radioactive material was released. The forces on the warhead were immense. Sounds pretty safe to me.

Pruitt, \"the Anchorage Republican, said those tax breaks are a fundamental component of a tax structure like the state’s that is trying to encourage companies to make investments even when oil prices are low, like now.\"\n\nWe need to wait a year and use the CBR with $8 Billion until the glut has passed! \n\nThis New Draft would eliminate all but one of the state’s tax credit programs, Alaska is going to be in bad shape if they do this kill the Alaska oil industry now!",

Thirdly, the effective tax rate of major corporations which turn a profit is 12.6%--NOT 35%--again cutting their \"taxes\" is a joke. Finally, giving tax breaks to publicly traded corporations will lead to their stock price increasing, while the government losing out on tax revenue will now be forced to sell treasury bonds which the wealthy will buy which will in turn lead to taxpayers paying them interest on the money they received from the tax breaks.

He got fed up with being made to move.  Indeed all of the people I filmed who left the streets did so only because they were exhausted by the sweeps.  All of them said that if it weren’t for the sweeps they would still be living on the streets.  So how compassionate is it to leave them be?

A family of 4 making only $32K per year would be right around 140% of the federal poverty level.  Assuming that they don't qualify for Medicaid (due to owning a home), they should be able to get Advance Premium Tax Credits to cover most of the cost of their insurance premiums.  At their income level, the ACA stipulates that they must be able to purchase a Silver-level plan through the exchange for roughly 3% of their total income.  Since 3% of $32,000 equals $960 for the year, that would work out to $80/month, once the tax credits are applied.\n\nAre these neighbors buying their insurance on the state exchange?  Is it a Silver-level plan?  Are they applying for and getting the tax credits that they're entitled to?  If the answers to all these questions are Yes, then there's no reason they should be paying $1795/month.  That just doesn't compute.",
