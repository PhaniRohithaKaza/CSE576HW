This is especially noticeable in nearby Mission, B.C. where the foreign investor tax does not apply and the sub $500,000 houses are vanishing.  Mission is about an hour drive from Vancouver center.  Many new detached houses in Maple Ridge are priced around $800K to $900K, which seems shockingly high for this area.  It looks like prices are wanting to converge near $1 million for a detached house. Is this even possible so far from the center of Vancouver?  The next year should tell. Maybe there will be a flood of listings in the spring of 2017, but at this point that looks unlikely.",

NAACP conversely is a civil rights group due to 400 years of anti-black racism and white supremacy. \n\nAffirmative action for whites is the default setting in America and has been since the 17th century on this continent. It used to be called the good ol' boy network. That's what the nature of anti-black racism is about. Centuries of inter-generational race-based slavery, followed by segregation, denial of access, voter suppression, terrorism was put in place to preserve white preferences and affirmative action. That's also what Manifest Destiny is.\n\nDonald Trump is the poster boy for white affirmative action. He's the unqualified boorish mean racist divisive white candidate who was elected because he spoke to white backlash, not because he laid out any realistic or specific policy proposals (\"I know more than the generals\" and \"I have the best words\" and \"Muslim ban\" aren't realistic policy proposals).",

Neither the Police nor the Army can stop them. The only way to limit this kind of attack is through the use of neighborhood Militias.

Management deserve no credit (or financial incentives) unless they can demonstrate CONTROLLABLE COST (i.e., independent of fuel cost) efficiencies per Watt of energy generated or sold). There is no indication that this was the basis of bonuses paid. \n\nThis requirement in the context of Eskom, however, is very ambitious.

Every one of my competent teachers managed to carry their workload, and get me up to speed inside of 1 month. Most of our educators cannot teach at this level, and this is why larger class sizes hurt our system when larger class sizes assure proper funding.

Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a \"homosexual lifestyle\".[1]\"  \n\nIMO, the \"real\" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as \"second-class\" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.  I don't feel that goal is unreasonable.  As used by those right-wing Christians it's a epithet designed to force homosexuals \"back into the closet where they belong!!!\"   Gary Crum",

The truth, I suspect, is that Weinandy feels the implicit rejection of his personal approach to religion coming from Francis, and instead of prayerful reflection he (characteristically, I am sad to say) attacks.\n\nOf course Weinandy, like each one of us, can think for himself.

Whatever tires one has, prudent defensive driving under given road conditions (lower speed, greater spacing between vehicles etc.) is the single most important safety tool in preventing accidents.\n\nI wonder if the uninterrupted parallel pavement grooves in the driving surface represent the greatest threat to the driving public, such hydroplaning in the summer. Last week driving home from Anchorage, we encountered some snow and ice on the highway. The conditions were easily dealt with by slowing to 50 or 55 mph.

It seems there is a lot of money / resources directed towards seniors and the ultra-rich, but the middle class (which is still families making $200K+ family income in Vancouver) don't have a lot of focus.  I think we need to investigate removing the capital gain exception on homes, but allowing for mortgage interest deductions on income.  Also, taxing income on couples vs. sole income in keeping with what seniors have would help.  If we don't start focusing on the younger people, we won't have any left in our major centers.",

First Jeb Bush was supposed to be the candidate nobody in the Republican Party had any chance against, and then Clinton was the overwhelming favorite in the election. And yet Trump won, despite spending considerably less money than Clinton (this is a good thing if one thinks money is too big a factor in elections, isn't it?), and having most of the media and the establishments of both major parties against him. He worked harder than Clinton and won. And there were only two choices, so what Clinton did matters.

No party has proposed a meaningful way forward for this part of the economy and the people who dependent on it. There is a second part of the economy based on design, technology and innovation that is growing rapidly but is largely urban. This is also poorly understood but is currently thriving.

Am. of course they did, since a mere 160,000 Spanish settlers eventually intermarried with about 8 million \"indians\"). In N. Am. they were, unfortunately, herded, isolated, moved, and systematically killed. They were considered savages - a culture which was viewed as primitive. A blot on our history to  be sure, but the gene pool became predominantly European.\nIt's neither unusual nor unreasonable for many to want to retain our identity, our culture, our norms, our laws, our values - which many believe are largely responsible for our success.

When police weren't getting hurt because of their protective gear he ordered the feds not to give police across America surplus gear because it wasn't fair to the protesters who had no protection .  Some have even said behind the scenes he ordered to national guard to stand down and not stop the destruction.  Over and over again he sides with the thugs and not police.

This stopped in the 90's, consistent with the timing of the increase of the labour supply with higher immigration. There are no new jobs and the ones we had are disappearing (globalism). We have slightly increasing GDP, but decreasing GDP per capita, so the pie grows slightly but the number of people taking a slice of the pie has grown exponentially. The only reason the GDP is growing at all is the injection of future taxpayer funds into the current economy (deficit spending) because current tax dollars cannot support the population drawing on the funds and without wage growth (due to labour oversupply) the tax pot cannot grow (even with population growth, three million more people without a job is using more taxes not paying them in). It can't be solved with higher immigration: it can only be solved by lowering immigration levels.",

It wasn't all that long ago when I actually heard an elderly person say about a young boy, \"That one's gonna be a priest.\" In other words, \"He looks gay, so steer him toward the priesthood pronto so he won't be a social embarrassment to the family.\" So this is still happening even now.",

GM didn't do it for the money. They made this move for the good of the human race! \n\nAs globalization frays at the edges, this appeal to a higher good is increasingly being used to justify a relentless assault on the Middle Class. Free trade is all about money and profits. There is nothing spiritual about it. And just as in any other material transaction, you must weigh the costs and benefits. When the costs outweigh the benefits, you do something else. On Nov 8 American voters decided the costs of free trade were too high. This is coming from the American people, not just Trump.

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

So right off the bat, that makes them fundamentally different from other retail businesses. Cannabis' closest comparison is liquor stores, which do have state-wide a distance regulation, but OLCC opted to leave this to municipalities because they didn't feel they had enough data yet to make statewide restrictions. Store locations will be regulated, but it might be too late for the small, local businesses by the time state-wide regulation comes around.",

We place it in shackles with BBBEE and AA thereby restricting it so places are limited. Hey presto, you need BBBEE and AA because the economy is not expanding and therefore competition for jobs is fierce. A zero sum game if ever I saw one. It is not working except for the lucky and connected few. So what do we do? We ramp it up.\nBe brave. Try something new. Get rid of the restrictive red tape. The economy will expand, investment will arrive and, guess what? More jobs will be created. Blacks will fill most of those positions simply because there are not enough whites to fill them.

If someone who is homeless or incarcerated or has diabetes is 1/8 Hawaiian, 3/8 Chinese, and 1/2 Caucasian, activists will award a full tally mark to \"Native Hawaiian\" victimhood and will award zero victimhood tally marks to the other ethnic groups.  This is statistical malpractice -- actually lying.  It's a scam which has been going on for decades, and nobody seems willing to call out the scammers for fear of being politically incorrect.  But it's a great way to make it look like \"Native Hawaiians\" are the biggest victims of all bad things, and it enables tycoons of the Hawaiian grievance industry to keep getting government and philanthropic grants to perpetuate their \"research\" or \"service\" empires.

Islam was originally founded in a desert area by nomadic peoples, not the sedentary cultures of today.\n\nThe Koran encourages violence in many ways, like allowing men to beat their wives. It  encourages Muslims to stike out against non Muslims.  All very good 1500 years ago but maybe not today. Yet Muslims of today still take guidance from this holy book, created so long ago.\n\nI should hope that during Ramadan the author will set asside wishful thinking and reflect on this connundrum.",

AGW has increased sea level (and likely, the wind velocity of cyclones), which exacerbates the surge.\n\nExtreme precipitation and flooding are yet another dangerous component of cyclones.

This is beyond what many can afford. Thus these people are on a merry go round of antibiotics and pain meds. In the ER every 10 days or so. Each visit costs the system about $700. Treatment for a brain abscess would easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nMost of these rotten teeth are due to a history of neglect and lack of basic dental care.\n\nI believe that universal dental (no cosmetic procedures need be covered) is the best answer.",

It's a dirty secret none of us ever talked about publicly, but we all knew it. When we were accepting high school grads into our program, the names were provided to us in order of their high school marks, beginning with the highest average. Starting with those whose average was over 90%, the ratio of names reflecting Asian and Middle Eastern parents versus names reflecting European or North American parents would be about 20 to 1 or even higher. Get into the 80%er's, and the ratio would be lowered to about 8 to 1 or so. Get down further into the 70's, and the ratio would be 1:2 or more in favour of the kids with names signifying European ancestry. Of course, marks alone don't signify ability but, if you talked to the highest-scoring kids, they saw university as a great opportunity, well worth the hard work.",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

Minimal prep time during the instructional day to plan, grade papers, contact parents etc, all necessary parts of the job now expected to be done in the evening and weekends. Having the opportunity to enjoy the different culture many have chosen to live in, interact in the community, explore the outdoors all add to retaining teachers in rural Alaska, unfortunately too many administrators don't see the value of it and instead are looking to extract as much labor out of teachers in 2 to 3 years and then have them move on.

The \"West's\" record in the region is that it is batting zero. Saddam's ouster created chaos and death in Iraq and led to the rise of ISIS. The removal of Gadhafi destabilised Libya and allowed extremists to terrorise that country. The US attempts to arm and support rebel groups in Syria ended up helping ISIS install itself comfortably there too! Assad, like Saddam and Gadhafi, is awful but what are the viable alternatives? The Russians, also ruthless admittedly, saw that Assad was the only option to stabilise the country which was relatively advanced in some areas before this mess started. Russia also is a long time supporter of Stria along with Iran. If the US wants regime change in Syria, it puts itself in direct conflict, potentially militarily, with Russia and Iran. We also have the question of just how chummy are Trump and Putin?",

If one compares things on an apples-with-apples basis, removing Morneau’s unprecedented $6B contingency reserve from the March 2016 budget forecast, that forecast was for a deficit of $23.4B; the October PBO forecast was $22.4B, and they have now dropped that to $20.5B. So far, for April-to-November 2016, the Liberals have run a $12.7B deficit, as compared to the $1.0B surplus in the previous year, all but the last weeks of which were under the Conservatives. Even if the PBO is right, this is still more than double the deficit that Trudeau promised us during the election campaign for 2016-17, which was supposed to be less than $10B. The net debt-to-GDP ratio will still rise from 31.1% in 2015-16 although Trudeau pledged that it would fall every year he was in his office. Although they don’t show this, if the PBO forecast is accurate it may be 31.6% rather than their previously forecast 31.7%.",

If other countries are so committed to this issue, one wonders why they're all having a conniption over having to do it at their own cost instead of getting paid to do it by American taxpayers. Is this agreement really about climate change? Or is it just about hitting the US up for another lucrative handout?",

Norway decided to invest for its OWN future and qualitative improvement in its society, not forced growth.  Norway realized the costs of forced growth never catch up to related social & maintenance costs. Now, Norway's Statoil-based pension fund is worth over $1-trillion. Not bad for a population base of almost 5.2-million. All Canadian gov'ts continue to run huge growing debts/deficits, trying to 'grow' out of debt -- always turning riches into rags.

Trump is merely taking a path that provides less government control of economic activity.  Many companies and individuals are currently cash rich.  They are looking for investments that make sense.  At the present time, renewable energy does not make economic sense in terms of most bang for the buck.

Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men?

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

The Ducks have six Pac-12 games left that are winnable if the coaches can figure out how to improve the defense to average.  Four victories make them bowl eligible.  This game against Cal has all the drama a fan can ask for.  The players are playing for themselves and this senior class to go out as winners.  The coaches are coaching for their jobs.  The rest of this season has the possibility of being as exciting as any played by Oregon.  College football really doesn’t get much better than this!",

Ms Weekes does not do service to the benefits of screening and threatens to risk more women opting not to screen and lose the benefits of early detection. We know that mammograms are not perfect, which is why we strive to improve the detection of breast cancer through research in supplemental screening with digital breast tomosynthesis, breast MRI and breast ultrasound.

And Facebook is totally there for you!\n\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.",

As a pedestrian, you STILL have to be careful:  look both ways (left, right, then left again), and try to make eye contact with drivers, just like we were taught in kindergarten.

It could have been issued to monitor his cell phone, home phone or even a pay phone used by spies, and it could have been phones in the Trump campaign headquarters where Flynn had an office.  It would be nice to know.",

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Obama's spending was reduced by a small amount by the sequestration cuts agreed to by the Republicans and Obama. Obama's spending was also reduced by a Republican Congress.

Sometimes that person just darts out and walks or runs or bikes across a roadway regardless of what color the light is or what the walk/don't walk sign says.  Sometimes the light changes while a person is still in the road crossing, even if it began as a \"legal\" crossing.  And sometimes they get hit and injured or killed. Sometimes they're obeying all the laws and end up hurt or dead, too.  But to hit a person and then not stop, that's just not acceptable, regardless of who was \"in the right\" on the roadway.

In October 2016 he co-celebrated a kick off prayer service celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in Lund, Sweden.

Sad to say it created the start of a breach in our relationship. My interest in such an event was immediately suspect; as well that I would have a close friendship with a devout Lutheran. Later that year, (as in prior years) I accepted an invitation to sing in a Christmas Cantata with local Methodists performing happily at both churches during the season. Again, suspicion reigned supreme. \"Why are you singing with them?\" \nIlliteracy about the above subject is one thing and, yes, most of us have matured biblically & theologically, but pockets of  16th century ignorance still prevail.",

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

This number is understood to be the compensation for the \"worst\" injury one can suffer--which is generally understood to be quadriplegia in a younger person.  Extra damages are available if the injury requires nursing care, loss of earning ability, and similar amounts for losses or expenses caused by the incident.  It is exceptional in Canada for injured persons to win millions of dollars---if they do, the injuries are severe.  Now look at Mr. Khadr.  His experience, the Supreme Court said violated his rights, we have to accept that.

There were a few papers that discussed atmospheric aerosols, which do have a cooling effect, and these were the likely sources of the myth, but there were no mentions of an impending ice age. The Clean Air Act 1970 resulted in decreasing aerosol emissions.",

Today, while access to information is far easier, it remains a relatively costly pursuit and requires some talent - advanced studies are never open to all.  But, as we have seen, knowledge percolates slowly through society and we all grow because of that.  Feynman's playful \"Q. E.

Islam in North America is called the \"Religion of Peace\" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system.

A 6% tax today will eventually need to be a 30% tax if we maintain the same level of State government we have today. How do I know that? I attended the budget brainstorming Walker had here in Fairbanks two years ago. The math worked out that, without oil revenues, every income producer in the State would need to pay 30% tax to support the current level of government services.\n\nSo, I did the math. Currently, I wouldn't be paying much under the income tax, but I already pay 25% to the feds. In 10 years, if oil decline continues and state services remain at current levels, we will all be paying 30%. That PFD will mean nothing to me at that point because, if my income remains steady, I'll be bankrupt and living in a ditch.\n\nReducing the PFD for three years won't kill you and it, along with cuts, will balance the budget in five years.",

There was inconvertible evidence that Bishop Barros Madrid was an enabler of a pedophile bishop. During his installation, as Bishop of Osorno, Barros Madrid had a highly contentious ceremony and had to leave under heavy police protection.\nFor all his image building, Pope Francis still has own problems trying to protect pedophiles or taking the nomination from the nominating group for bishop.

For the One True Way to be restored, Clintonism had to be delegitimized.\n\nThat delegitimization ushered in the politics of party restoration at whatever cost, governance and country be damned. This led first to an attempted legislative coup in 1998 and then to a judicial coup in 2000. And to all the more recent outrages of birtherism, government shutdowns, delayed Supreme Court confirmations and, ultimately, the rise of a would-be autocrat as a party nominee. —Susan Faludi",

Huge difference to your argument.The Senate did not impeach him and he resigned his law licence. Therefore he was not impeached.

He was factually acquitted. You might also note that 100% of the Democratic Senators voted not guilty while both guilty and not guilty verdicts were rendered by Republican Senators.

When food isn't readily available, the whales draw from their stores of fat and the toxic chemicals come into their blood stream. This may explain the problem of orca calf deaths.\n\nThe transients seem to enjoy eating our harbor seals and the 2 species of sea lions in our waters.

Fr Mychal, if canonized, will no doubt become a role model for gay Catholics ... someone we can pray to intercede for us when the going gets tough. Actually, he is already that for many of us. MSW might characterize us as those who deny the church's teaching on homosexuality ... as if that were a bad thing. But it is the magisterium that denies the God given giftedness of our sexuality, and which needs to repent of this awful sin.",

He believes that, under the philosophy of \"Live and let Live\", Muslims have become less concerned about integration and more concerned with replicating the culture of the community's original country.  He has recommendations that would promote integration of muslim and non-muslim schools so that children do not grow up demonizing the other culture. He recommends that the country insist on its values and laws through the supervision of Sharia courts, of which there are 85, to ensure that British values of human rights and gender equality are respected.

I do not wish to be part of a privileged minority who sets themselves apart from and more special than others or who believe they are somehow above the law.   Jesus walked among the people - not above them.  Actually, Jesus walked below the people - ministering to those who had otherwise been neglected, ignored or outcast.  Clericalism creates elitism, not the humble acts of selfless love that Jesus modeled. \n\nLauri Ann Lumby, OM, MATS\nAuthentic Freedom Academy\nOshkosh, WI",

Two different issues to me. It seems that a bunch of white people who don't have friends from other religions or cultures are quick to jump on the perceived \"politically correct\" bandwagon without understanding what the niqab represents. (Reminds me of the stupid naive white non-Muslim Ontario politician that once said we should allow Muslim immigrants to practice sharia law in Canada if they want.)

In the end it's a very personal decision. And as long as the environment remains hostile, it's understandable why some people like priests would not want to risk having members of their congregations attack them verbally, or report them to the local bishop, which would surely happen in almost every case, putting their livelihoods at risk. Would you have the courage to do that? If I'm being honest with myself I'm not sure I would.

There is no question about many of them having served with honor and distinction, but they did so serving in positions aligned with their sex at birth and wore uniforms consistent with their biological sex, of which there are only two, male and female.  However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

The budget, as far as I can tell, is a paltry $4 million. Frankly, it makes me question if Steve even knows what the various departments he lists does.",

We've driven to California and back twice -- top down when the sun shines, and still able to take it through a car wash (which I would never do with my soft top car). I rented a 428 convertible in Florida for a week this past spring. Nice car although a bit tamer and softer than I was used to (maybe the 440 has better driving feel?). Biggest ergonomic complaint is that BMW has switched back to putting the cruise control switches on the steering wheel -- a really dumb move. The third stalk cruise control on my older bimmers is so much more intuitive and easy to use without taking your eyes off the road. I'll probably look for one of the last 335s when it's time to replace mine.",

Will Kim feel obliged to conduct an atmospheric test to show that it hasn't?

Who have had everything taken away from them, culture, Life. And now you want to dress up as some white wash racist version of them for fun? Oh you poor whites! /s Seriously people get used to it. Race and culture are not costumes for your consumption and enjoyment. And yes this line of thinking is going do die with all the old racist white people, and I for one with my beautiful multiracial family cannot wait.",

There is no justification for Trump's failure to stand up and be counted with our other leaders of this country that have come forward to denounce this evil racism for what it is.

Your mission simply seems to be the first to rush to potential new scenes and take credit on reporting first so that you can carry that ol’ hipster line of ‘I knew it was cool before it was cool’. Congratulations on another expedition into the unknown, at least for those that thought East Portland was Gresham up until this point. No doubt bourgeois liberals will be rushing out to East Portland to slum it out before they completely take it over and sell their own high end versions of halaal meat, tacos, and binh mi sandwiches, while explaining the merits of the free market to the freshly displaced.",

My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming.

I do though, from both, and here's what I can tell you if you'd be willing to not be a snarky wiseass and listen. In 1994 when her husband was signing his ruinous crime bill, Shillary referred to Black youths as \"animals\" and \"super predators\". And in 1989 when 5 Black and Latino kids were falsely accused, arrested, tried, and convicted in the rape of a Central Park jogger, Trump took out a full page ad in the NYT calling for the EXECUTION of these boys.",

The Dallas police killings happened because of the murders of two black men in Baton Rouge and Minnesota by racist white police officers this past week.

This cycle of violence has to end.  \n\nAnd it was most definitely NOT Black Lives Matter that inspired Johnson to kill.  All other press reports say that he was a follower of the group called the African American Defense League, which is on Facebook.
