They also made it near impossible to get an MM card, and if you did, you were subject to a courtesy check to make sure you were in compliance with the law, which is vague at best.

Still, to the chagrin of my peers, I never let them point toy guns (or even their fingers) at a human and say \"POW!\" No squirt gun fights, playing 'Army', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Cowboys and Indians' or Grand Theft Auto type video games (These came out later and as \"adults\" they played them anyway...). And I screened (to the best of my ability) their intake of movies and TV. Perhaps I was viewed as a hard ass, but, I know first hand that it sucks to be shot. Yet, guns have always been an important tool in my life and I'm not one to throw out a hammer over a black thumbnail. I've kept them handy and I've kept them loaded.

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

She promised to stop fracking. Obama already halted construction on 2 major oil pipelines. One of them cost 3 billion dollars and was 600 yards from completion. Too bad for those investors... the capitalist pigs. Russia's main export is oil and America's plentiful oil and gas was destroying their markets. \n     According to the smartest man in the room, the Russians join forces with a capitalist energy proponent (\"an imbecile and a fraud\") who praises the benefits of cheap American Oil, Gas and Coal. Upon the completion of the fixed election, rigged by the Russians, Trump unleashes the fossil fuel industry from crippling Obama era regulations, opens up drilling to once closed government properties and permits the construction of the two controversial pipelines. Oil prices drop everywhere. \nRussia's income shrinks. Are they that damn dumb?",

The honest recipients are forced to spend all they receive.  Just as an example that benefit is spent on groceries, clothing and other basics.  Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).

And as for patrolling the Seward Highway, it's a state owned road. Let them patrol it. If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance.

What matters is what it means today, what people understand when they hear it. Not what it meant once upon a time.\n\nThe word \"proves\"used to mean \"to test and show to be false\", giving English the expression \"the exception that proves the rule\" - which literally meant \"the exception that shows the rule isn't actually a rule and is not really true\".\n\nOver time \"proves\" lost the meaning of \"to show the falsehood of\" and only the meaning of \"to show it's true\" remained, and the proverb survives even though it's modern day meaning makes no sense. It's a kind of bizarre claim that the the rule is true BECAUSE there are exceptions to it.\n\nWords change their meanings over time - and if you don't know the current meaning, you cannot communicate honestly, logically or usefully.",

Mr. Trump's many gaffes are videotaped..no \"out of context\" involved.  The man is, again in my opinion, totally unfit to be President.  He doesn't have the intellectual background, the knowledge base, the moral base or the emotional stability to be President.  I have previously posted the definition of a \"sociopath\" and Mr. Trump exhibits every characteristic.  Again, check it out for yourself and make your own decision.  Indeed, the media gives him a lot of coverage..what do you expect.  The man is one of the two major candidates for President of the United States and his actions and comments are \"newsworthy.\"  They may be strange. They may be bizarre.  They may harm his chances to be elected.  But, in the end, they are his actions and comments.  Don't get mad at that \"damn liberal media\".  Get mad a Trump for being such a terrible candidate.",

They're chumps, born and bred. so buried under their own shame and humiliation and ignorance they don't dare admit how thoroughly messed up they really are.  They're cattle and happy to be that way, so why blame me for leading them to slaughter?\n\nModerator:  Fair point.\n\nTrump:  Sure, every once in a while a lie blows up in my face so bad I can't dent it away.

Now we can't make a case for the cocaine.\"\nSame as a prosecutor investigating MAFIA underlings to build a RICO case against the mob boss. She may use a drug case as a means of gaining cooperation.",

That was a lie and an unnessary one, showing Trump has very thin skin. The same with his insistence, despite photographic evidence, that his inaugural crowd was the biggest ever. Why? More serious is his accusation that Obama wiretapped his campaign offices. So yes, Trump cares very much what people think and say about him.\n\nWhat the polls say is that a huge majority of Americans think Trump is doing a bad job. If Trump doesn't score some successes (getting Gorsuch approved would be one, but how many Americans even know what the Supremes do?) then he will be judged a dud. AHCA was an awful bill. Ryan tax reform and the Ryan budget will hurt a lot of average people. Let's see what Trump gets from Xi this week.",

As Thaler and Sunstein put it in Nudge, economic theory and policy needs to be based on “Humans”, not “Econs.”  I looked forward to learning about the new improved conception of human nature, which presumably would be informed by evolutionary theory.

A devout Presbyterian who favored bow ties, Dellenback was admired by constituents of all political persuasions and steadfastly refused to accept any campaign contributions. He was among the many Republicans swept out of office in the wake of the Watergate scandal, losing his seat to Jim Weaver, a liberal Democrat from Eugene. Dellenback later directed the Peace Corps in the Ford administration. In Congress, he crafted legislation establishing the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area and holding contractors accountable for oil spills from the Alaska pipeline. Eugene is fortunate to have Dellenback's daughter Barbara in our community continuing her father's philanthropic activities.",

I don't understand how so many Canadians delight in showcasing our divisions and posting such gratuitous and inaccurate criticisms of our government leaders in public media. Worse, so many seem to delight in the thought that we could suffer at the whim of a reckless bully. Where is the sense in that?",

It becomes what I like to describe as the ‘altar boy’ syndrome. In truth it is adults not acting with responsibility, not taking part with a mature yet demanding sense of agency within the Church. When this doesn’t happen, as was certainly the case up till more recent times, we are left with blind loyalty instead of mature conversation. We are left with blinkered defensiveness and kneejerk reactions rather than open-mindedness, willingness and engagement. This all leads to a heavy sense of inertia where energies turn in on themselves, people become demoralized, and ultimately are defeated by the system – or they simply leave. \"\n\nThe people on the Pontifical Commission just haven't left yet.",

In fact, alcohol use is likely more dangerous to society and statistically it certainly causes more deaths. It also has a greater adverse impact upon our health care system.

I have been reading about the CCC quite a bit lately and the homeless/unemployed of the 1930's that enrolled for 6 months with the CCC were extremely proud of their service. They were paid $30.00 (worth $539 now) a month and $25.00 had to go back home to their families. But they were fed, clothed, housed, trained to work, and many developed advanced skills. Watching the interviews of the \"veterans\" of the CCC relaying their experiences reminded me of WWII veterans doing the same. Somehow, I think the answer is somewhere in a program like that. Some may have to go to rehab and some to an infirmary before proceeding on to work training.  Some camps could even be set-up for homeless families.",

After all we only have hundreds of thousands of miles of pipelines that have been operating successfully & safely for almost a hundred years.  Nothing new here.\nYet... without a word or regulatory hearings  this carbon spewing industry (yes... that's what cars are) gets to build an expanded plant----WITH  government money!!!!\nWhere are the protestors, all the Indians demanding their share, people pleading they have the right to block this development because of social license??   What a bunch of BS double standard hypocrites.\n\nSo what's different,  Could it be that it's Ontario and poor Alberta has the oil?",

In the Dubbya's Dad Gulf War UK anti-aircraft missiles purchased by Iraq were redirected away from coalition aircraft, who were told not to bother with counter measures.\n\nSometimes the interference is unintentional, but predicable in advance:\n\nhttp://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/lightsquareds-gpsinterference-controversy-comes-to-a-boil\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2012/02/15/technology/lightsquared_gps/",

During the latter part of Carter's term, there was open discussion in the Senate about taking the nation back to WWII-style gasoline rationing.  It would have been an enormous change in lifestyle and mobility for us, and probably instant economic depression.  Instead, what happened?  RR comes, loosens hidebound rules on domestic oil exploration; production goes up, prices come down - and *continue to decline (in constant dollar terms) clear through 1998*.  During that time, D6, every 1 cent drop in the price of a gallon of gas was $100 million saved by the American economy - *every month*.

If each individual gave sacrificially from what they have, then we build communities one at a time. Jesus never taught us to demand governments to provide life's essentials.

From what we know, Trump took nearly a billion dollar loss and deducted it from his tax burden, in effect denying revenue for the government that other tax payers have to make up. Yet Trump maintains huge personal holdings including his own jet and a gilded NY residence.\nIn contrast, those of us who take their legal deductions for such things as children and property tax most likely have a few toys, but most of our income goes toward paying for basic needs, like a modest home, a vehicle, clothing and feeding our family. \nA deeper irony is Mukavetz criticizing others for criticizing Trump since we don't \"plus up\" our tax.

Clearly, the point here is that the DEMs have vowed to create all kinds of problems whenever and wherever they can to hinder the process of good governance.  The courts did what they did because of what they had interpreted to be an unconstitutional order and stopped it from being enforced.  ACLU should help POTUS resolve his problems with the DEMs, since they claim to do all sorts of good things, and like the courts are non-partisan.  You must be dreaming if you believe what you had stated in you post.  Yes, the job of POTUS is not an easy one.  It takes an iron will and determination to prevail at all costs.

It always puzzled me why the Bishops thought it was appropriate to comment on an email exchange they had no business looking at. And in doing so they were playing exactly the same role they accused Clinton's staffers of playing: using the church to promote a partisan political cause.

All of the agencies included in the estimate of public expenses take wildlife management and habitat protection seriously, even if it isn't their main function.

The Port, however, has elected to use indirect costs of administrative expenses and depreciation to eliminate this surplus. In reality, the Port should address its own glaring increases in administrative expenses, from inflated salaries to the overuse of expensive consultants. It is disingenuous to argue that the Port subsidizes its marinas. Indeed, it is beyond time for the Port to recognize its marina tenants as valued partners in supporting the Port's myriad activities, many which have negative cash flows, through moorage rates.",

One would be severely hamstrung to drive beyond city limits or take a long trip should the need arise. It will be the same for the Chevy Bolt. Neither have a viable alternative to Tesla's Superchargers to at least compete for charging. When coupled as a hybrid with the optional engine, the i3 s no longer an EV and there's better alternatives out there. Also, the i3 the design is limiting for those with growing families. Finally, BMW's reputation holds limited value given 1) their vehicles don't seem to hold up after the warranty expires (4 years), 2) parts tend to take a long time to deliver so the vehicle is unusable for long periods of time and 3) design tends not to be future proofed.",

It pays lip service to the conservatives, hoping we'll be stupid enough to continue voting for the GOP, but in practice, it's a left of center political party. The battle you see in the GOP right now is a case in point. The confused, ill-informed and angry are voting for Trump, the conservatives are voting for Kasich and Cruz, and the rest of us are considering a 3rd party. But similar pressures are happening in the Democratic Party as it too drifts to the left.

With BC wildfires, jihadist assaults worldwide making investors nervous and other impediments to growth on the horizon it could be that May 2017, when the growth rate from May2006 was 4.6%, was as good as it will ever get for the Canadian economy under Trudeau, with much lower growth rates ahead.",

Aquinas followed Augustine in saying that \"If you do away with harlots, the world will be convulsed with lust.\"  Public morality has probably changed since then.  The world would not be \"convulsed with lust\" if prostitution were prohibited; nowadays, sex is free.  Thus, Augustine's and Aquinas's rationale for prohibiting prostitution disappears.  Almost.  They were also against prohibiting acts that people are hell-bent on committing.  Such prohibitions are futile, and in the end, breed disrespect for the law.   This is not good for the state.",

I have said it before and I will say it again, it is the single family dwelling that is the scourge of the housing market. The single family dwelling drives up the cost of municipal and provincial government services. The single family dwelling is what makes our commutes so long and miserable. The single family dwelling harms the environment. And those living in single family dwellings are not paying their fair share. One thing to remember though and this is very important.

Even if the results of the four cardinals' intervention/formal correction did not mean canonical schism, you'd still have a very open, ugly, public de-facto schism between those with and those against the pope as we already do. \n\nMore to the point, Fr. Reese makes it clear that he doesn't take Jesus seriously. Three Gospel accounts report the ban on divorce and remarriage as adultery. Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees is not contextualized by concern over the social/economic difficulties of women put away by husbands (although I'm sure he cared about this).

The police did what needed to be done; protect the public, protect themselves. They are not taught to shoot to injure, but shoot to kill. Now suddenly these so called \"know everything\" videos that are being posted on YouTube suddenly change when the truth starts coming out.

They have duplicated the very processes that they complained so vigorously about during the 'original' health care act.\nIt's just that every other major country has some sort of national health care.

When Royal and TD raise or lower their rates, the others generally follow suit, because those are the two largest banks and almost always lead the way on the setting of interest rates. Higher rates may lead to bigger profits for the banks and maybe more dividend increases for their shareholders. That's a good thing, because bigger bank profits and higher dividends also mean more tax revenues for the federal and provincial governments.

The tragic reason is not because the socio-economic order inadvertently places males and females in different areas of the community (as I first thought) but because girls are valued less and not taught survival skills. During the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, four times as many women than men died, partly because they were never taught to swim or climb a tree! (Note: PanInternational arrived at the \"14 times\" figure looking at all disasters, not just the 2004 tsunami.)\n\nGirls are also less likely to be rescued than their brothers because males carry on the family name. After the disaster hits, girls are subject to another barrage of male assault--rape; unwanted pregnancy; child marriage.\n\nGlad the whole \"mother\" thing is being critiqued too. Getting old.",

Yeah: BILLION, when all programs, special assistance aid and other items are added in. \n\nSo, that is still way, way more than the cost for a one-shot 30,000 Syrian refugee influx, and a whole lot more than the 3 Billion we provided in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Syria over a 5-year period. (Source: Government of Canada)\n\nNow, if you want to talk Bigger Bang for the Bucks, I'd likely put the refugee program ahead of First Nations, (and certainly Afgranistan/Syria aid) although it'll be a generation before Canada sees a \"return\" from refugees.

Also, refreshing to see at least *some* acknowledgement in this thread that ostensible adults in our society should take some personal responsibility for their own behavior.  \n\n \"... quit paying for emergency care ...\"  Interestingly enough, if the law didn't require me to have insurance and I just paid out-of-pocket, cash-on-the-barrelhead for my healthcare expenses - on an annual basis, I would be *way ahead* financially.  *Way* ahead.  \n\nThen I could have all that cash available to meet my own future needs as they might arise.  Instead, those $$ are siphoned of by an all-knowing bureaucracy (to pay for government overhead), and perhaps, to pay for other people's healthcare (so that they don't have to themselves, as long as they keep voting Democrat ...)  :-/\n\nHard not to feel that the System regards me as a Chump.  :(",
