Our best estimate is 2,000-3,000 at any one time.\n\nIn my experience, Eugene has always been a hard place to make a living.",

It promises to turn back time and take no prisoners. That it can appeal to those who do not understand its consequences is doubtless true. But the first job of those who do understand is to state what those consequences invariably are. Those who think that the underlying institutions of American government are immunized against it fail to understand history.

He is the type of student for whom a traditional liberal arts education (which encompasses science and math) was designed.  In an ideal world I believe he would choose to pursue his passion for music but he is also of a practical bent. He would also be well suited to a life in academia as he prefers theory over the applied but that role has been sacrificed by universities on the alter of profit.

After a couple of years of digging, that's all a partisan prosecutor could find against Bill Clinton. \nThere's nothing unconstitutional about a prosecutor working an investigation finding evidence of other, related or even unrelated crimes. And of course, it's constitutional to pursue those other crimes. \nWatergate started as the investigation of a burglary and led to related crimes that brought Nixon down. \nSay a judge signs a search warrant based on evidence of an illegal poker game in Joe's basement. The cops come in and find they're not gambling, but there is an ounce of cocaine on the card table. Do they walk out and say: \"Darn, too bad the warrant's for illegal gambling. Now we can't make a case for the cocaine.\"\nSame as a prosecutor investigating MAFIA underlings to build a RICO case against the mob boss.

Sometime around last summer, list prices caught up to the real sale prices, so the places that sell now are actually going for asking, or slightly below, however the sale prices still show a stable or even slight upward trend and the market is only \"balanced\" in the sense that now you might actually have a chance to make a slightly lower offer and/or have time to do a home inspection instead of just losing a bidding war. Prices are still about 40% higher than they were two years ago.\n\nThis is not the sound of a bubble burstin, but if it were, it would be good news to most people.",

Jesus moved us away from exactly that sort of thing under Mosaic Law (prevalent at the time of His public ministry on earth) and it is exactly what those true to Vatican II have been trying to do, despite those who think they know better.

Only a small fraction of the increased costs is due to renewables. He is right in pointing out that the gas plants were overbuilt in Ontario and that has also added to increased costs. But the bottom line is, a renewables policy well implemented over time, as costs go down, is in fact the cheapest option for Ontario.

And as Goebbels taught us, repetition works. Germany, France, active in Afghanistan with NATO, were attacked. Myth becomes accepted as fact.

Rail is a tool that can be used to help increase transportation alternatives and reduce traffic congestion, but it is certainly not the only tool available to the City.  The City can increase rail ridership by changing zoning codes to allow for greater mixes of uses and lower parking requirements near the transit stations (TOD policies) as well as by building more bike lanes, better sidewalks and promoting other transportation alternatives such as carsharing and bikesharing.  All of these policy changes and transportation choice improvements are already underway in Honolulu.

Liberals didn’t like it because it would have hurt so many people -- upwards of 24 million people would have lost health insurance and health care.\nDuring the campaign and transition and even in the early days of his presidency, Trump promised simultaneous repair/replace, seamless transition, universal coverage, lower costs and better health care. He was lying. \nRyan promised that when the Republicans replace the ACA, no-one, not one American, will be worse off than under the ACA.

In Peru, perhaps other Andean countries, some clergy are very open about their committed but of course \"unmarried\" relationship to a woman and \"their\" children. When the parishioners know with whom the priest is sleeping, they can usually rest assured that he is not on the prowl for other liaisons.  While in some countries a common slur might be \"hijo de puta\" or \"son of a whore\", in Peru it more commonly would be \"hijo de cura\" or \"son of a priest\", because that is the equivalent of \"bastard\" being that the biological father is forbidden from marrying his defacto common-law wife. But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment. In the rest of the world, fooling around is just that and borders on abuse which is traditional.",

There is a clear difference between this construct and the 90's independence movement, in which some extremists argued that all non-Hawaiians should be forced to leave an independent Hawaiian government. \n\nThrough the reorganized Native Hawaiian government we would not be a new state or replace the state.

I can understand the fears for young kids in a modern big city neighbourhood but in my neighbourhood - this goes even for older kids.     Eg:   my street is full of street basketball nets even though there is a school with a full outside court 400m away.     When I was a 13/14, my friends and I would go to a park or school to play pickup basketball and whoever was there joined the pickup game.    Games would sometimes get pretty intense, especially if another neighbourhood group would show up.     Now, many parents in my neighbourhood buy these single street nets so their teenage kids play in front of the house.   Always the same handful of kids - never any outsiders - never being challenged - never seeming to ever play an actual game.     It's kind of sad.",

Another example is the article's inconsistency concerning the use of past returns to judge managers, both rejecting and endorsing it.  If we're to rely on past returns, I suggest we rely on the S&P's Passive Vs.

One on-line calculator put that at about $107,000 in today's dollars. Perhaps not top executive pay, but substantial for those times, particularly if one possessed reasonable money management skills. And, speaking of public education, a whole lot more $$$ than teachers, even in Alaska, make today. \n\nTo go even a little further afield, I'd warrant that acquiring good money management skills would improve the lot of both rural and urban Alaskans.

This is the role of the media, to challenge readers to view issues from a different perspective.\n\nSecond, you miss the entire point that your palate is influenced by what you eat.  The author completely missed that fact.  How can a reasonable food critic not understand that?  Faux meats have a place in the world, not because they're perfect replicas but because they fill a need.

Education? If Ms DeVos has her way, public education will become a thing of the past and education will simply become a commodity to be sold to the highest bidder.

Remember, we, the citizens, gave these government agencies (including the military) their life and resources. We deserve to know what they are doing with our public funds and American power.",

I'm an Alaskan first and an American after that. When I vote, I vote for Alaskan interests. New Yorkers are permitted to vote for their own interests. And, truthfully, that is how we live ... until we get a president in office like Obama who thinks the whole country should walk off a cliff in lockstep with his commands ... which was exactly the reason the Founders created the EC, so that New York could not decide for Rhode Island who Rhode Islanders would vote for.\n\nBecause when you do away with the EC, the election is decided by the big cities (always for Democrats) and the rural and exurban areas have zero voice in the government from now on.

He has been on Enbrel for 4 months and it worked great at first but now he has started having flare ups. Garrett also plays football. His dad is actually the coach for his school team. He was limited during the season due to ankle flare ups. It was encouraging to read the article about Alex and his success. As you know it is so difficult to find anyone with this same illness. People don't understand when you tell them. And before now. I have only been able to find adults or teen girls with JIA and no one has ever heard of AS. Any advice would be so welcome.",

Eccles 9.5,6 supports a Sadducean view that our limited material existence in this life only is all that is open to us.  9.6 '... neither have they anymore a portion FOREVER in anything done under the sun...'\n3.

As others have noted English, History, Philosophy and others are often precursors to future degrees notably Law.

Some disciplines just have seeming more obvious paths or mesh well with identifiable job titles.  Although that too can be source of frustration - like assuming that everyone with an accounting degree files taxes for a living or that everyone with a law degree plans to be a trial lawyer.\n\nIt seems to be that if you feel your degree is being undervalued that perhaps you haven't done a very good job at articulating your educational background and career aspirations.

Let's not enact legislation that sends us down that road again.\n\nAt the very least we should be sure that the social cost of carbon isn't actually negative.  The planet is currently greening, at least in part due to higher CO2 levels, and that's likely to be a benefit.

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

I find it interesting how nicely your particular approach to climate change lines up with the interests of builders, aka the big money in this town.

Of course I am commuting in via car, because Portland is actually an awful place to ride these days.  Your attempts to push us into apartments and busses is easy to sabotage, which is why Canby is turning into a bedroom suburb for Portland.

The bite was so bad that they couldn't stitch it together.  The wound had to heal on its own and once fully healed, I would need plastic surgery.  The dog was also not vaccinated, and I had to have rabies shots.  Those were extremely long needles that were placed on alternating days in my abdomen.  They were excruciating.

Employers will work their existing staff harder to compensate.\n-If you are an adult supporting a family and you make minimum wage; it's not society's fault or the 1%, it's yours. What did you do with the first 25 years of your life?\n-This gives employers a stronger motivation to use technology to replace people. It's already happening; the fast food cashier will not exist in 2-3 years. Regular cashiers will not exist in 5 years. There are dozens of other jobs that are in their last decade of existence.\n-You can't legislate your way to prosperity\n-Paying higher wages for low skilled work sends the wrong signals and destroys incentives. You are not supposed to live comfortably in low skilled jobs. Otherwise, why would anyone try to do better?",

As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\".

Sad to say, the episcopal culture doesn't allow for a \"backing down,\" much less a \"we were wrong\" coupled with an apology.  So we've now had 3 or so generations of Catholics who have pretty much rejected the church on this one (typically 85-90% in studies), yet the bishops plod on as good company men.  In doing that, they project an air of superiority, and even contempt.  That was going on BEFORE the scandal, and the emergence of women to a new place in secular society.  \n\nThe work that's needed is indeed foundational.

I figured the Gunslinger came to town to do his \"Dirty Work\" for which he is known,  and fire Mr. Horton.   After the game Mr. Kilkenny  talked to Mr. Horton about whether the U of O was going to renew his contract.   I was surprised that Mr. K  gave Mr. Horton his vote of confidence and stated that the U of O would renew his contract.  So, again, here you have a donor making very important U of O decision's.

No one wants to come home and find out that your \"kid\" had a drinking party (large or small) at your home while you were gone. ...and, indeed, some consequences would usually follow.  We may have done it, but damn it, our kids better not!!\n\nChief Kerns, however, because of his office is in a tough position. Had he known of this event and \"covered it up\", and that \"cover-up\" been exposed, he'd be receiving considerable criticism.  Now, because of his being more \"hard-nosed\" than most of us would likely have been, some are criicizing him for not simply handling the issue \"in-house.\"  In sum, Chief Kerns can't \"win\" on this one.\n\nI've had several discussions with Chief Kerns and feel he's a very decent, honorable man.

The 1993 renewal agreement ruled that it would continue to be the target after 1995, and it has never been changed since.

Public and private schools operate under different sets of rules.  Private schools get to pick and choose who walks through their doors.  Public schools have to take all within their area.  If a kid doesn't want to be there, doesn't show up half the time, and causes problems for teachers and other students, a private school gets to give that kid the boot.  Not only can a public school not boot the kid out just for being a slack, but that kid MUST be tested and counted in the results.  The school then has to chase down said kid to take a test that not only had no bearing on his/her academic life, but the results of which will likely drag down that school's scores. TBC..",

Both in the past and today, they point to the fact that private dwellings aren't required to have fire suppression systems. So why would we require them in apartment buildings, office towers or... barns?\n\nIt's clear that requiring fire suppression systems in apartments, etc didn't destroy the housing and construction industries. The reason why is that these systems are but a tiny fraction of the overall construction cost, and that cost is fully recovered over the life of the building. In a poultry barn's lifetime it might house millions of chickens, so the installation cost per bird is just pennies. It's not like it's going to send your grocery bill through the roof.",

Or should it provide for the 30% -35%? \n\nSince the US has an even bigger problem than we do with social welfare, perhaps sort that out at the same rime. A Guaranteed Annual Income for the poor would be one way. Cancel out Medicare, Medicaid and local welfare programs. That would pay for the Guaranteed Annual Income for the poor. \n\nThen all Americans can run their own lives. No social housing. Access to the best medical system. Then see what happens to US health data.",

However, by 2009 6 of the 10 largest North American Banks by capitalization were Canadian Chartered Banks because of the losses incurred by the leading US Banks.\n\nIn short, regulation by Federal Government and agencies in Canada were instrumental in saving our Chartered Banks, our domestic financial system and the Canadian Government and people loads of money and the preventing a deep domestic depression from occuring here.",

There is a huge amount of viable habitat in the Snake River drainage that isn't being fully utilized.  Furthermore, other ESA listed salmon and steelhead in the Columbia system utilize the Snake before backtracking and moving into their drainages.  Most of the \"record returns\" of salmon are hatchery produced fish and not wild fish that spawned in their native rivers; the increased rate of return is largely attributed to better ocean conditions and less with the dam operations.

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

Sharing shalt be a choice, for all else is tyranny, and it shalt always be subject to receiving something in return, so that one shalt feel good about oneself. Remember this: the temptation to throw bread crusts at a starving man is frought with peril, for once you give a hungry man free food, he will become dependent upon you. Make him learn the hard way, selfishness begets virtue\". \n\nIs this the Jesus you speak of? Maybe there's a different one, I think? Depends on who one asks?",

Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"\n\nBlacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.\"\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/13/van-jones/van-jones-claim-drug-use-imprisonment-rates-blacks/",

Id be interested to see National Geographic explain away that bit of logic but on this issue it would seem ignorance is bliss. Jordan Peterson-a man licenced by our government to treat sufferers of this condition- has offered open debate on these issues and until any of his detractors engages in that, Ill reject it outright.",

We have constitutions, by-laws, constituencies, business meetings, executive committees.  You are behaving like, and being treated like, a dissident shareholder.  Seventh-day Adventists don't have heretics, and you are no Luther.  Everybody knew what Luther was talking about, agree or disagree.   You might as well be calling Dr. Zinke and Elder Wilson Neanderthals.  You've written an incoherent essay, arguing vague similes are profound insights.\n\nYou write: \"[Faith should be used as evidence? Whose faith and evidence about what?]\"\n\nThis is the heart of Christianity: Medieval and otherwise.  Faith in Jesus, in His divinity, in His resurrection, in His Kingship, in His atonement and His soon return.  \"Faith is the evidence of things not seen\"",

Was kidnapped by certain people in Iran linked to the complex maze of terror fractions. Demanded ransom to release the more than dozen people. Qatar gov finally capitulated and paid up to $1 billion. The money now available to finance all kinds of nasty stuff in Syria and where's not. With this payment of ransom to kidnappers in Iran (but not the Iran government) Saudi (who hates Iran more than Uncle Sam) blew its top and severed diplomatic ties. This is also why Egypt did same. \n\nBut in the Middle East everybody is a crook. Why Saudi just spent $110 billion, $350 billion over a decade, but buy the most nasty weapons from US. Hit Iran?

As (I am sure) Mr. Callan knows, adding ramps for buses on the elevated guideway also places rail collections to date at risk. He probably also knows that urban magnetic levitation is the quietest and most environmentally friendly rail system. A maglev-only guideway for the remaining ten miles to Ala Moana Center would not require concrete “shielding” for noise and would be much less physically and visually imposing. It also will save hundreds of millions of dollars in construction costs, and billions later for operations and maintenance.",

The scientists knew that the ridiculously elaborate models needed to explain astrological movements were nonsense and that putting the sun at the centre made way more sense, but they knew that if they said otherwise the Church would (possibly literally) have their head on a platter.  It wasn't until evidence became overwhelming that the church acquiesced and admitted error. \n\nPeer review works great when you use empirical, evidence, and most of the modern world is a product of this process. Attacks on it are usually politically motivated and driven by dislike of the findings that arise for whatever reason.",

We have print media, spoken media such as radio, visual media such as TV and film. We have electronic media such as this forum and the internet. In each medium different persons, committees, and corporations exercise some editorial control, but in the US and much of the world, unitary control doesn't exist and we have a broad diversity of views, and disagreement over the facts. This is not true in Russia where all media are strictly controlled by a state with absolute power, including the power to jail, kill or banish any opposition.\n\nPutin is good for Russia?

Religious music is one of the best examples of \"Sturgeon's Law\" I know of (the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon was told, \"Ninety percent of sf is crud\", to which he replied \"Ninety percent of EVERYTHING is crud\".) Yes, today's music also exemplifies Sturgeon's Law.\n\nBTW, Montanism was not condemned solely for having women priests. It was largely condemned for its theological beliefs. Your statement is simplistic at best.\n\nWe think about the teachings. If they give us good arguments, we accept them. Crap gets rejected. The arguments against ordaining women are crap, for example.",

Yes, it relies heavily on the train rather than simply walking.  By relying on the train, distance between concourses and the terminal becomes mostly irrelevant (the train gets you there in just a few minutes).  Thus they were able to spread concourses out more, allowing room for expansion and making it safer and better for the airplanes to maneuver on the tarmac.  \n\nIf you're walking the skybridge, then you're choosing the long walk instead of the train which is the primary method provided.

While \"capital\" has always been important, the fortunate few who have held meaningful amounts of it have always required labor to produce goods.  For several decades the supply of total US capital has steadily been consolidated into fewer & fewer hands. With the advancement of robotics & AI, automation is likely to steadily eat away at the number of available jobs - to the point where eventually there may not be enough of them to go around.  What does the US economy look like if only capital (and almost no labor) is required to produce goods? One can debate the speed & scale of automation, but eventually we'll need to find solutions that transcend conventional debates between fiscal conservatives and social liberals.",

In other words, an apparent discrepancy disappears--Jesus accept divorce on the principles of Leviticus (adultery), and reject divorce as a male prerogative that can be exercised for any reason. \n\nAnd that leave Paul as the ONLY passage that has Jesus rejecting divorce without exception, and Paul demonstrated with his action, that the Church had the authority of override Jesus as Paul understood him.\n\nFinally, after all of that, I would invite them to read Amoris Laetitiae, and understand it as the Church still struggling after 2000 years to deal with divorce. \n\nThe purpose of the internal forum is not to defend the magisterium over against individual conscience, as you suggest.",

I'm so confused!:)   \n\nBut can you blame me?  After all, since the terms \"fuck you\" and \"fuck you assholes\" have, within my lifetime, been transformed from perhaps the worst things we could say to each other to now totally defanged and democratized parts of everyday speech, how can it be that vertically extending one's middle finger should be \"saved\" for life-threatening experiences--as if that was still the case even 50 years ago?  The gesture, and its current meaning, date to at least the Roman Empire.  So it seems we should now know MANY things are more offensive--such as war!",

Nobody was sold on Drew Brees. As for Troy Aikman, he threw for 20 TD's or more only one time in his career. In the early to mid 90's the Cowboys were a dominate team. Between 1991 and 1994 Aikiman missed 8 starts. The Cowboys were 7-1 in those games behind Steve Buerlein, Rodney Peete, Bernie Kosar and Jason Garret. Aikman was the type of QB that would only be as good as the team you built around him. It's possible Siemian can become that as well. He's never going to be elite....but let's see what he can do with a solid line.\nThe Little Guy",

The argument is not wether if or if not marijuana can be harmful - we agree. You keep changing the topic, and trying to argue from a point you know I agree with you on.\n\nThe entire point I am disagreeing with you on prohibition. I am using guns as an example of something else that can have harmful effects that you don't think the solution to is prohibition. Why? You have yet to justify your inconsistency. All you've said is \"guns save lives\" which isn't an argument and surely not true in the majority of cases. Guns cause a lot of harm with or without the influence of narcotics.

The \"democratic deficit\" was the result of a continuing slide in voting participation. And the term did not simply refer to federal politics, it was heard throughout many provinces. BC, Ontario, PEI, New Brunswick and Quebec all formed a task force or commission to explore electoral reform with 3 of the 5 triggering referendums. \n\nIt's one thing to write a polemic, it is another to manufacture facts.

It's completely misleading to say that a Toronto homeowner pays \"less\" taxes than eg:  the 905.       What people are comparing is property tax rates, not the total tax bill.     The rates are per a phased in market value assessment.     Therefore, Toronto homeowners have seen a disproportionate rise in their property taxes as a result of the appreciation of their homes.     This means their total tax bill is proportionately higher for a physically similar property.     Eg:  a 1 million dollar house in Mississauga might be worth 5 times that if it were dumped into the middle of Toronto.\n\nUsing my own home as an example, I pay (rounding down) about $12K/year in property taxes (I'm including our separate garbage collection fee).    For that, I get old services.   Eg:   I had to replace the old clay sewer line this year at a cost of $10K (City Maple's tree roots encroached and broke the line).",
