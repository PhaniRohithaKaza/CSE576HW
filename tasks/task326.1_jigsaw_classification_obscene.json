That isn't exploitative. Of course, if you can find citizen labor sufficient to the needs of agriculture, willing and able to work for some reasonable wage, that would be great.

Indeed, they try their hardest not to.  \n\nWhen you say that for many NPR is the mouthpiece of progressives, I have only heard that from people who heard it from someone else.  It is one of those pieces of information that is passed from person to person on Facebook without any factual basis to back it up.  Pretty soon it becomes a meme and people just take it as word.  If you believe it for reasons other than you have heard it from someone else, then perhaps you have an example of their progressive leaning news coverage? I would be very interested to hear this.",

The 1 pays taxes on capital gains and other \"wealthy\" forms of income at 1%, paying $10,000/yr. The nation runs at a deficit, like ours.\nThe \"top 20%\" (1 person) pays over 99% of the taxes.\nAs you see, that isn't a good case for lowering the top person's tax RATE.\nInstead, it begs the question \"how can the top be paying so much of overall taxes while paying a lower RATE than workers?\nIt illustrates the enormity of today's income gap.

The addition was announced hours after former FBI director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\"\n\nLook, I have heard people from both the left and right (starting to jump ship already) mention that Trump lies, although they tend to use euphemisms, and not outright call him a liar, but if I (and probably the majority of Americans) had to vote for who was telling the truth here, Comey would win by a landslide.",

After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

Lyndon Johnson, had 100% proof that the people behind the assassination were the Castro brothers: Raul and Fidel. He chose not to make this known to the public because, in the words of his former Senate colleague, Richard Russell, with whom he shared his findings,\" Are you crazy? Do you want to start World War 3!\". Some historians call these weeks, Johnson's finest hour. And, no, there was NO Soviet involvement in the assassination. And, YES ,there was a second gunman. He was a member of the Cuban Secret police. \n\nThe leaders of other countries soon found out about the Castro's involvement.including the father of the current Canadian prime minister. And, both have gone on public as calling Fidel and Raul good friends of the Trudeau family.",

Governor Walker needs to order an in-depth investigation and then penalize the people responsible for inappropriate extended imprisonment of inmates.

The books title was \" A Gospel of Shame\". It was co authored by Frank Bruni and Elinor Burkett. This was obviously a book I had read several years ago as the pages were starting to yellow .I read the prologue and as I started reading the first chapter, I was struck by the story of a survivor whose story was very similar to my own. Actually it was my story.  The mans' name was Frank Fitzpatrick, who was a police detective in Rhode Island. In 1989, Frank was suffering from mood swings, a lingering sense of sadness and a constant urge to cry. Frank was married,had two kids and a good job. He could not get to the root of his sadness. He tried valium and also therapy. He could not find the answers.\" Then , suddenly, they erupted in a jarring series of images and sensations from a past he had long blocked out.\"",

As a business owner it's a no-brainer, why would you as a purchaser buy from only one source? The source will gouge you but if you have multi sources for the same supply they'll all want your business. Then you put out an open bid for the products you want to buy. It's Business Basics, you buy from the cheapest source to make your profit as in this case you put bids out to create cheaper offers for the consumers.

She does not use the words 'political correctness' but clearly that is the burgeoning, unchecked phenomena which threatens to hijack social media and drown out the rational, civil discourse that until now has molded public policy in this country. \n\nSocial media is a tremendous innovation. But unchecked, it offers a worm hole by which specious claims and special, narrow interests can easily bypass and defeat the checks and balances so carefully built into our institutional structures over the past 150 years.",

Typically, tax rates over 50% are in the red zone, but it is important to note the additive impact of  income, consumption and asset taxes, as well as the odd head tax.  \nIt is pretty clear from this government's attitude on enforcement that it knows it is well  into the red zone, and each spending splurge and disbursement scandal just adds fuel to the fire that pushes taxpayers past the Laffer Curve peak.",

Moreover, a good single-payer program would include control of medical education programs, to expand them and make programs tuition free in return for X years of service at comfortable but not extravagant pay rates.  A successful single payer program should also include the elimination of patents on drugs or perhaps a modification to allow generics with a fixed royalty paid to the developer.

Sure, there are powerful elements impeding the reforms of the council, but those reforms will eventually be realized. It is inevitable.

(tiny amount of ransom would have saved lives and captured the terrorists btw) Is this the logic you want to teach the world? This POS that belongs in federal prison gets rich by the same irresponsible government. Recall this pmo from office and restore the dignity of the PMO of Canada with someone of quality. Find a way. The current pmo gave a useless, ineffective statement he learned from a Hollywood movie in the 90s upon hearing of a tiny ransom demand last summer to save the lives of two Canadians.

As a teen deals with a faltering grandparent, wouldn't Lear have deep resonance for the student?

It's not just a diversion - it enriches us and can give us the tools to address our lives' pitfalls.\n\nOf course, the teachers are crucial.

He is referencing China as communist. \"The communists are keeping the globalization faith.\" China hasn't been communist since Mao Zedong. The world knows it as state sponsored capitalism.

Rolling those fees forward 20 years the $500 while admittedly sounds high isn't that far fetched.  \n\nThat aside whether the amount is $500 or $250 doesn't change the point.\n\nA similar issue prompted my to leave my full service broker.  The brokerage firm was bought out and I and others that I know were gradually treated to phone calls urging us to sell what would normally be considered buy and hold dividend stocks.  Clearly the new management was in favour of \"active rebalancing\" regardless of the client's long held objectives.\n\nAs a client of course when you aren't used to getting these types of calls and suddenly get one you are more inclined to be concerned that something is going on.  Unfortunately in those days interest information was still fairly primitive.\n\nThe positive of course is that I finally had incentive to go DIY",

And since insurance companies are trying to make money, they hate to pay out money in claims.  \n\nSince Delta is a Dental Insurance company, they must pay out money in claims for oral problems.  But . . again . . they hate paying out money.\n\nSo, if Mrs. Firman is paid to lobby for Delta (and who knows if that's true) then it must be because Delta has decided that water fluoridation is good for the oral health of the community . . because then they'll have to pay out Less in claims.

If they say it is a protest against racial injustice and not an attack on the flag, their interpretation should be respected.\"  Gestures are most often the words of bodily language.  One doesn't get to decide the meaning of the words he uses in speech.  (That's proved by the fact that you, dear reader, just knew exactly what I meant by my last sentence.)  So if the widely accepted bodily language is to stand during the national anthem, as a sign of respect, and a person kneels instead, he is refusing to respect the national anthem.  \nYou say they're not showing disrespect to the flag or the anthem, but that's false. Suppose instead of kneeling at the consecration, I stood as a protest against racism. That would show disrespect to the Eucharist.  Why? Because the whole point of that moment, the consecration, is to focus on the transcendent goodness of the Eucharist.  \n\ncont",

However the statement \"Both plants contain bacteria-killing tannins that disrupt fermentation without interfering with a cow's digestion.\" is flat wrong. The way a ruminants digestion system works is by fermentation and disrupting it or killing the bacteria is disrupting the process. Bacteria do the work and in turn the ruminants digest the bacteria particularly for protein. Dead bacteria do not reproduce and fewer bacteria to digest means less protein and that means less meat per feed input. Simple as that.",

And that's before prices effectively doubled again to the present. Vancouver has never had affordability so divorced from incomes.\n\nIt's common to reference interest rates vs. prices. I'd trade the present for lower prices and higher rates in a heartbeat. Why? Because each year you delayed buying, you amassed a bigger % of down payment by saving. Today, the reverse is true: each year delay, you fall further behind. That dynamic did not exist for extended periods in this region until the most recent decade - and that marks a HUGE difference. It can take 2-4 times longer to amass the same % down payment now as compared to the past - and that assumes prices don't keep rising.",

The point I'm making is that the Baby Boom ended 30 years ago, and these subsequent generations have deliberately smaller family sizes in Windward or East Oahu, so of course their schools are shrinking.

Why kick a gift horse in the mouth and do away or discourage tourism instead of manage it like the valuable and precious asset that it is?\n\nThere is gross mismanagement by the state and counties across Hawaii, where few gain at the expense of the rest.

During the pre-WWI period of mass immigration, when we experienced the highest immigration rate in our history, economic growth was apparently anemic, if one is to infer anything from the link. But in the post WWII period, aggregate economic growth was generally consistent throughout periods both of high immigration (1950s) and lower immigration (1970s). So, what conclusions can one infer? My guess is that immigration isn't particularly relevant to per capita economic gains although it may increase aggregate economic growth. Canada maintained high levels of non-European immigration during the decade between 2005 and 2015, where we experienced the worst real growth record since the 1930s, further undermining the argument that a beneficial economic impact applies.",

That is the reality. Confrontation, intimidation, societal division, material misrepresentation and violence are the practices of those who are influenced by Sol Alinsky.

To the contrary, not only did Jesus uphold the law, but He strengthened it by defining it exactly as God does so, in His repronouncemens regarding adultery and murder. I find it interesting He also supports the prophets as Ezekiel also called attention to the sin of homosexual behavior. So did Paul. In fact, no where in the Bible do you find any support to say homosexuality is not a sin. It is, as is lying, stealing, adultery, bearing false witness, etc. All who have sinned are instead enjoined to repent and turn from their sin.",

Surrey has hi-rises being built in it's city centre as well as the Guildford area. \n\nMany of the suburban communities are allowing very few single family lots. The majority are townhouses as well as 5 story condos. The suburban communities are also less dense because streams and watercourses have to be protected. In Vancouver they were just filled or diverted by underground pipes. Also the suburban communities have the ALR land that is protected. These lands will never be built on so that does affect overall density.\n\nVancouver is more dense because people want to live there.

This was very different from the Eastern European situation.\n\nVatican II was called in the wake of that experience. Teaching Christ needed to be overhauled so that Catholics would resist the totalitarian, warring, genocidal mpulses in their midst. Hopefully that has happened.\n\nIn response to these assertions, you listed a number of evils that currently exist in those countries.

You can't easily live outdoors in this country. Governments in most advanced countries either provide a large supply of subsidized units and/or institute effective rent controls to ensure that ordinary people can afford to live in large cities. At the very least, governments should ensure that those people, like seniors and the disabled, who live in large cities should be able to do so. For people like me who have impaired eyesight and can no longer drive and/or physical impairments and lack mobility, living in the middle of nowhere is not an option. With an aging population, rental stress will lead to many negative outcomes, no doubt including a higher suicide rate among seniors and the disabled.

Leitch is a pediatric surgeon, has an MBA, and is an MP - she is more qualified than the drama teacher with a famous last name. The Globe needs to lose the smug tone and get over themselves, the issue with M-103 is that it specifically mentions \"Islamaphobia\" while leaving out all other religions, this despite growing anti-semitism across Canada (\"punch a zionist\" today  at McGill with impunity - imagine if zionist had been replaced with Islamist - heads would roll... but we can't talk about the double standard that demands one religion be treated with absolute deference whereas others are fair game, because it's 2017...",

These are additional staff members who will receive their teacher salary PLUS an addenda with no assigned students? I can't say that I have ever heard a teacher complain about not having a teacher consultant! In fact, I had always thought that was the principal's role. Just today the district terminated a memorandum of agreement with a private agency that provides student support services in schools. They are paid by the student's private insurance, provide more support and opportunities for the students and now, as class sizes increase they are dismissed without explanation. It feels less and less like public school. So much goes on behind closed doors. I hope our school board represents the citizens because I have my doubts about the system. Oh, by the way- I know of two new district level administrators that were hired this year and aren't in jeopardy of losing thier jobs.",

Those shootings deserve a full and fair inquiry and those shooting victims too deserve justice.  But tonight I watched Dallas turn into a combat zone, with a military style operation targeting police officers who were there simply to protect the very people protesting them.  And when those officers began to go down - assassinated by a team of snipers; instead of running away - they helped civilians, covering them, evacuating them and doing what we expect police officers to do.  I have never been more proud of a police department since the valiant efforts of the NYPD and NYFD in the wake of 9/11.",

But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

For instance, Pope John Paul never explicitly invoked infallibility to shore up his teaching about the ordination of women; neither did Pope Benedict. But Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, did; in doing so, Ratzinger did not in any respect add to or detract from what JP had already written. \nI bring this up to argue that this fuzzy way of thinking about church teaching, about authority, response and reception of church teaching, about conscience formation has a provenance in recent papacies. Trad and RR both evince ignorance of the Catholic tradition; but they may have heard these distortions in Catholic classrooms or pulpits in the past 25 years.",

The softwood tariff is the result of a long (seemingly endless) argument about how we manage our public lands for forestry and the timing has nothing to do with Trump.  NAFTA is the Trump issue.  As for THAAD, I expect South Korea to quietly tell Trump to pound sand, since the US are putting THAAD in place less to defend SK than to annoy both NK and especially China to make China act against NK.",

And if the complainant was on alcohol or drugs, that too is a source of concern. For example, did a friend or family member supply intoxicants to the child/youth in the course of the sexual assault? And when intoxication makes the complainants statements unreliable, are the police stamping \"Unfounded\" on files in such cases? Surely you can see the potential problem with that.\n\nEveryone's going to have to come out of their comfort zone on this issue if we're going to make a significant difference.",

I know you've been around long enough to have heard it before, it was the battle cry for starting Tebow when Studesville  took over as the interim coach following McDope's firing. Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

You seem to just blame and ridicule anyone who questions or is critical of Trump's policies and behavior. And given Trump's performance and behavior to date, I think there is a lot to question and criticize. Maybe, just maybe, the problem is with Trump, not so much with his critics. \nCriticism, just to get your name in the news, or to only score partisan political points undermines democracy. But I expect and want thoughtful, well reasoned criticism from our other officials when they think the country is going down the wrong path. That's democracy, and loyalty to country before loyalty to party or any one individual. Be that individual Trump or anyone else.",

Either that or our QB is not locating and directing passes their way. I find it hard to believe Ursua had only one reception for 14 yards prior to exiting the game at the half with an injury; or the SJS db's did a better job at pass coverage? UH has in the past (before the Chow era) always had success in their passing game.  I also felt that bringing Rolo back would re-ignite that aspect of the game?

The amount of crap I took from teachers and/or administrators because I am not Christian was pretty damn frustrating.  That crap was everything from being sent to detention for not wanting to sing Christmas songs praising Jesus as a part of a required Christmas pageant, to being told pointedly that I would fail a class if I missed a day for the Jewish High Holidays.  Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

He followed the simple premise of no starch and no meat together, along with only eating fruit until noon each day, that he lost so much weight so quickly that people asked him if he was suffering from something serious! He would respond that he was 'food combining' long before anyone else seemed to have heard of it. Never an overweight man, my dad used food combining, and simply walking to/from his office downtown everyday to keep his weight and fitness in a good way for decades.

They have yet to face a team that's playing great--the Ducks are a very good team but were missing some key guys--but even so, they're fun to watch, they seem to be having fun playing the game, and maybe most importantly, they're controlling the play more than they're reacting to it.\n\nSupposedly there were a bunch of scouts in attendance last night.

The gravel containing the finer bits of gold was then washed over the mercury coated copper plate and the gold stuck to it.  The mercury-coated gold was scraped off the plate and this was heated to vaporize the mercury.  Native gold is usually about 18-20 karat.  To purify the gold it was mixed with borax and heated to high temperature.  The gold melted, the impurities combined with the borax, everything cooled down, the slag was chipped away and Voila!  24 carat pure gold.",
