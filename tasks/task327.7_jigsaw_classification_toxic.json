The word of the Bible that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom declares that the internal liberation of human beings to live the responsible life before God is the only genuine way to overcome stupidity.\nBut these thoughts about stupidity also offer consolation in that they utterly forbid us to consider the majority of people to be stupid in every circumstance.

Consider getting the best bacon cooker ever made for the microwave oven. I’ve cooked bacon every way possible. One thing is for sure, fresh bacon is built for the microwave. It has a high fat and water content and it is thin, so it cooks up crisp and tasty.\n\nNow, this is not some cheap drug store bacon cooker. Granted, I am biased, since I’m the inventor and all, but it cooks 23 slices of bacon all at once. It is quick, clean, easy, and healthier. The drippings fall away. You’ll never go back to cooking it in the oven or on the stove-top. Check it out at http://www.baconpro.com and watch the video about how it works.

Consideration of his nomination was rushed through on Friday so that Senators would not be burdened with any influence from the 3,500 emails between him and his owners in the fossil fuel industry that a federal judge ordered released last week, which the public will finally get to see tomorrow. Pruitt, who got $350,000 in contributions mostly from the coal, oil and gas sectors, squandered taxpayer money for 2 1/2 years litigating against release of those public records in a case brought against him by the Center for Media and Democracy. On behalf of large and powerful polluters, Pruitt sued the EPA thirteen times to make sure that the industry would not be fettered by regulatory protections of water and air quality. His actions have particularly endangered the one in ten Oklahoma children who already suffer from asthma attacks",

I have called them on this many times and found the Globe unable or unwilling to address it.

The recount attempt was ridiculous from the beginning, because it was based on nothing, except a childish unwillingness to accept the election result, and this recount was also clearly politically motivated, since it only focused on three key states Trump won by a smaller margin, and not on the states Clinton won narrowly, such as New Hampshire. Anyway, the concept that these recounts would have changed anything was a fantasy from the beginning, and no serious expert expected any significant change in the results.",

Without going into how false that thinking is, the original question still stands.  What happens when it has to stop?  Most of these mistaken individuals believe in the concept of sustainable growth which is pretty embarrassing for them because, after all, sustainable growth is an obvious oxymoron in a finite world.  The answer to the original question is collapse.  There is only one outcome from perpetual growth in a finite world and that is collapse.  To me, planning for a future where society collapses is not very intelligent.  This article could not be more wrong.

So the small guy, who doesn't have any political power, gets hit with the full burden of the tax while the biggest polluters are exempt from most of the tax?\nTranslation: This is a really stupid tax that will ruin federal provincial relations again and will take thousands of man-hours in both the private and public sectors to process for no discernible decline in carbon emissions but will make us look as if we are really doing something.  \nMan!

The hierarchy is part of the problem, but I observe many lay people who feel comforted with the idea of an authority figure making all the rules and decisions for them.  A lot of Catholics, lay and ordained, do not want the challenge of expanding their vision, challenging themselves with self transformation and organizational transformation.

Both Hank and Chubby were black--most R&B covers were performed by white artists--sometimes in a mocking send-up. The biggest hit of the Diamonds' chart run was a good example. Little Darlin' was designed as a send-up of the Gladiolas' hit in their doowop style. Wow: nobody laughed as the version by the Canadian quartet (true--more irony!) became Billboard's #3 song of 1957.\n\nFor over 3 decades, impossible to buy any Checker originals, nor of ANY of Cameo-Parkway's stars (Dovells, Dee Dee Sharp, Bobby Rydell, Orlons) due to legal disputes. Just re-recordings. The originals were finally released in 2005. Sad irony: music fans had moved on.",

The outcomes you allude to - the lowering of the pedestal and the willingness to confront sexual abuse - were two positive repercussions of Vat II and the sexual revolution. People became more 'realistic' and less naive when it came to the humanity of clergy and the reality of sexual activity and the taboo against talking about it or the possibility that clergy were actually sexually active. I think one issue that this report raises is that these 'reforms' haven't quite penetrated the culture and thinking of those in developing societies, especially where it could be that many a clergy has joined in order to ascend out of powerlessness and poverty. Like many of their Western counterparts, those who joined for such reasons decades ago had the perfect foil behind which to hide their ulterior motives and which thereby allowed them to feel little concern or compunction about breaking their vows.

His own members fear him, either because they are frightened to lose the corrupt money they are receiving and/or facilitating, or they fear for their jobs and livelihood. Even those that oppose him and disagree with what he does are frightened to take a stand and collectively overrule him.

As you said in your message, there is a lot of work to do and not a lot of time until the midterm election of 2018. Most Republicans have been running on a bluff: Repeal and Replace Obamacare. They seem more surprised than even the Democrats are that they, the Republicans, now have the presidency and majorities in both houses of Congress. The American people have called their bluff. It is clear that they have nothing with which to replace Obamacare; and the best estimates are that it will take them at least three years -- past the 2018 midterms -- to devise a plan. Trump has said that Repeal and Replace will happen simultaneously and seamlessly; Ryan says that the plan will be implemented in such a way that not one person will be less well off than s/he was under Obamacare. I think they're both still bluffing. We'll see.",

The Teranet National Bank HPI had an inflation rate of 13.5% in March, up from 13.4% in February.  The other owned accommodation expenses inflation rate of 3.5%, down from 3.6% in March, while it looks impressive, also likely badly underestimates actual inflationary pressures.

Jacobs scrambled to his knees and said something about his glasses being broken. He asked Faith, Keith and myself for our names. In shock, we did not answer. Jacobs then said he wanted the police called and went to leave. Gianforte looked at the three of us and repeatedly apologized. At that point, I told him and Scanlon, who was now present, that we needed a moment. The men then left.

No wonder so many private providers have closed up shop.   My understanding is the cost is about $5,000.00 a month for regular  assisted living homes. The state system needs to something much closer charge market rates for assisted living homes.  The idea was nice when we could afford to give it away to people who had built this state. Most of the rest of us who were born and raised in Alaska will never have a place in a Pioneer Home.. OR we could provide the same subsidy to all assisted living homes so that all seniors can get into a facility.

If you have a sizable RRSP which when converted to a RRIF will force minimum payments at a higher taxable rate, would it be advantageous to delay CPP/OAS until 70 and live solely on RRSP withdrawals from 65 to 70.

Is this a beneficial strategy or will the higher CPP/OAS at 70 counteract the reduced minimum?\nSay you have $900K in RRSPs + 100K in non-registered at age 65 when you retire.  How would you minimize the income tax paid over the next 25 years (keeping below the 45k bracket)?\n65 - 70: RRSP withdrawal only at 55K/year plus 20K from non-registered\n70 - 71: CPP/OAS 25K + 35 K RRSP plus 15K from non-registered\nThis would leave 700K (assuming low growth ) for RRIF conversion\n71 - 99: CPP/OAS plus RRIF minimum",

You need to base your spending on how much revenue is incoming. Whatever comes in, then that's what you get to spend - not a dime more. That's called a balanced budget. And yes, Congress is NOT doing enough to reduce spending. Analogy: if you make $100k at your job, but then lose your job and find another one that only pays $80K - do you keep spending as though you still make $100K? If so, you're a fool.

He does not know where to begin, where to draw lines - he is frozen, unable to act.\n\nI don't think he is going to solve/resolve the issues of roles of women, gender selection rather than assignment, modern marriage, euthanasia, contraceptives, abortions, and family being defined as only one man, one woman, procreating with every sex act.

It actually has nothing to do with the fight for U.S. independence that having been declared 38 years prior during the Revolutionary War on July 4, 1776. It was later set to the tune of an 18th century English drinking song and renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at that time, and became the national anthem in 1931. The War of 1812 was an ambitiously misbegotten war undertaken by the United States in part to seize Canada from Great Britain, which was then distracted by its struggle with Napoleonic France. The war did not go well, and when Napoleon was finally defeated and the British turned their attention to North America, things got even worse for the Americans.

One of the changing aspects of Hawaii's economy over the past few decades has been how many of the luxury homes and condos are owned by non-residents. These people are not subject to the state income tax and, if they are here on a part-time basis, don't contribute much towards he GET. Raising the LOW property tax on high-end properties makes sense IF it is done wisely, with a GRADUATED increase in the tax rate rather than a sudden jump, as the City's \"Residential A\" tax increase has done.

The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), who has no reason to favour the Government or the Opposition in his forecasts, still projected a $1.2-billion surplus on December 1, still based on the Conservative government’s budget measures, although the Liberals were now in office. It is notable that the PBO projected, by my estimate, about $115.2B in direct program expenditures for 2015-16 on December 1, as opposed to the actual estimate from the annual financial report of $122.1B, a difference of $6.9B, some of which could be ascribed to policy changes under the new government. So on balance it seems probable that the Conservatives would have obtained their surplus in 2015-16 if they had remained in power, although it is something that the Liberal government will never concede.",

I believe that John McCain would have made a good president, with high ethical standards and a moderate conservatism that would have served our nation well.\n\nAt the age of eighty, many things can go wrong with our bodies, leading to our deaths.

This subtle shift was necessary because the warming as evidenced by satellite measurements has stopped since 1998, even while CO2 concentrations have continued to increase.  It has become increasingly obvious CO2 is not driving the warming, the climate, or anything else.\n\nFor the last 600,000,000 years temperatures have hovered around 12C about 14% of the time, around 22C about 50% of the time, and somewhere in between 36% of the time.  Right now we are at 14.5C, about 25% above the bottom of the historical range.  (Ref: Dr. Christopher R. Scotese‘s PALEOMAP Project at http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm).  We are no where near any temperature tipping point.\n\nGet the facts at\nwww.aconvenientfabrication.com\nwww.windpowerfraud.com",

Alaska has produced more oil per capita than any of them. If we had retained the same share of profits they retained, and deposited the extra money in the Permanent Fund, your dividends would look a lot more like dividends in Bahrain Kuwait, and Qatar, about $60,000 per year.

Their explanations and conversation were quite entertaining, and became even more so when Oprah opened it to questions from the audience, and a Greek Orthodox priest stood up and condemned the film as blasphemous. There ensued between that priest and the Catholic priest an exchange that could have taken place in the 5th century: \"He has one hypóstasis!\" \"Yes, but two phýseis!\"",

He spend $757 Billion on his recovery act  but got private companies to help stop failure of auto industry, banks, etc. Affordable care act, a biggie at $104 Billion but still kept down by taxes which supported the program. Obama was also forced to CUT not add to his programs by the sequestration cuts he agreed to with Republicans. CBO scoring total says Obama added $983 Billion to deficit. Lesson: This shows how much entitlements alrady in place before Obama contribute to the deficit— scary— even GOP can only make a small dent in entitlements.",

The retention study cited was seriously flawed in that it began during the deep recession at the end of the Bush presidency when most of us were happy to have and keep any job.   \n\nSecondly: Mr. Wang’s experience is typical for TFA teachers. Many use this two-year public service commitment to help their nation and strengthen their vitae. Education Week, Oct 4, 2011 reported that after five years, only 27.8% of the TFA teachers were still in teaching. \nTFA teachers are often viewed as well-intentioned and inexperienced. By the time they gain experience, they move on to their primary job, like Mr. Wang. Struggling schools can use beginning teachers, sure, I’ve never heard an administrator wish for a constant supply of well-intentioned beginning teachers with only 5 WEEKS of teaching preparation.",

My own sister, who left Catholicism when she married a Presbyterian, said the one thing she misses most about the Catholic Church is the fact that people leave you alone when you enter a church out of respect. She likes the fact that you can go into any church, say a quiet prayer, and no one will hassle you and begin accosting you with personal questions. In a word, Catholics let you be. Evangelical megachurches won't leave you alone.

It seems there is no correlation between IAT results and real-world behaviour.  All it seems to mean is that anyone taking the test recognises 'others' in the most basic sense (which may be hard-wired into their brains by evolution) but when faced with real-world challenges they easily overcome that and don't discriminate.\nEven you, Margaret, have hard-wired biases.

Putting Osweiler in behind the same O-line that let Siemian get sacked or hit on almost every play was done to placate the fans and the media.  Now that it didn't work, all the fans and sports writers want to blame Vance Joseph.  I don't get it.  You could put Tom Brady in at QB and have Belichick coaching on the sidelines and you're still not going to win any games with an O-line that has mediocre run protection and the worst past protection in the league. Philly is the best team in all of football right now, Wentz is going to go on to be the best quarterback in the league, so not sure why anyone expected to see improvement, especially by benching the quarterback for a worse quarterback.  Osweiler is so focused on his receivers that he's oblivious to the defenders around them.  How many times did he throw into triple coverage today?",

The excuse making for an offense that put up 10 points at home, 7 of which were in garbage time when the game was over, and giving up 7 points after a pick 6.  So in my mind the offense had a net 3 points.  Why do people hold Trevor in such high regard? This is what a seventh round draft pick looks like, one dimensional, virtually no athletic skill, and a weak arm incapable of throwing accurately downfield.

Darwin himself used it in some of the later editions of Origin of Species, meaning \"better designed for an immediate, local environment\".\n\nUnfortunately, Spencer and some of his followers took the phrase in what they called a moral sense,  as an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition. Some of the more extreme Social Darwinists said that the poor should not be helped, since it would be aiding the \"less fit\" in surviving.

Christian ritual mimicked pagan rituals as the simplest way to express the Christian mysteries in ways pagans would understand.\nVatican II changed all that, to copy Christ’s choice to reach out to us in a fully human form. Pagan ritual has largely faded from our consciousness, so alternative symbol systems were adapted.

It's dollar value is not worth the effort to recover it.  China should just keep it.  It just seems odd that China would risk their own economy by angering their best customer for their goods at the precise time when a new administration has stated they are going examine that trade relationship.  China's move in this regard seems clumsy and unsophisticated.  And their defense of their own actions is just funny.

Allegedly, we are doing this as a society because of what those symbols or historical persons or entities or hurtful language represent to some members of our society.  In other words a minority of people who object to playing by the new rules can be demonized, sanctioned or jailed for not conforming.

Racism was rampant, people were often killed for nothing more than their skin color, and segregation and discrimination were the norm.\n\nOther subgroups of the population, fared little better. Not long ago women had next to no rights, weren't allowed to vote, and if they're husbands beat them it was often ignored by the authorities if they ever even found out about it.\n\nWe've come a long way as a society since, but today we have a subgroup of the population  involved in the drug trade and they protect their business interests with a gun. The level of violence is very similar to that of the gangs that controlled the alcohol industry during prohibition.\n\nThere's also a subgroup who feel they need to walk around armed and dangerous and some of them are just waiting to be disrespected.\n\nOur society as a whole, however, has come a long, long way.",

If you gave someone 65% of the costs to run their business, you’d probably expect a pretty good return on that investment, right? Well, we used to have a windfall profits tax that did just that – provided a fair return to Alaskans as oil prices rose, but only after the oil companies made massive profits. That’s the provision that allowed us to save $15 billion between 2007 and 2012 – the savings we are currently surviving on today.\"",

The conventional view (like the stock market and pundits) is that tax cuts equal growth in job and GDP, but in actuality the opposite has happened. You just need to look at the history of tax cuts which started with Bush just after Clinton increased taxes and got the highest job growth in history, reduced the deficit, and after the those cuts continued and extended by Obama, we have never gotten the economic growth that Clinton got. One of Reagan's former economic advisers and a conservative wrote a famous book about this and the damage that Bush's tax cuts did because they did not match the environment in which Reagan's cuts were made. Today he advises strongly against tax cuts and he and some other advisers like David Stockman advise tax increases on the rich who have benefitted immensely from years of tax cuts without adding to economic growth and investment.",

Yes, the President has to say yes, unless removed from the scene by death or circumstance, but many many others are involved in the decision to launch.  The military has primary allegiance to the nation and its constitution - not the President.  If any President were to go insane and order a launch of American nuclear missiles without true need, it would be the obligation of the American military to refuse the order.
