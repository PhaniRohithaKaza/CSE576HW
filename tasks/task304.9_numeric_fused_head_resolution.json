How did you get into Scientology ? How did it all start ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Well , that - that is fairly easy . When I was , uh , a very young man , I spent most of my teens in Asia . And , uh , that is a , an area of the world , uh , where human misery and , uh , want , uh , are , uh , very visible , where , uh , Man has reached perhaps the lowest states of degradation , and a young man moving into that scene begins to ask the question , \" Why ? Why all this ? Why - What is this ? Uh , what depths can man fall to , and what is he , anyway ? \" And I began to ask this question , \" What is Man ? \" And , uh , I found oddly enough that nobody could tell me what Man was . Uh , what did he consist of , uh , where was he going , what was he doing ? I became very fascinated with this particular line of research and I made it my life 's work .\nTony Hitchman: Did you read widely of philosophy ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , but the philosopher , of course , has spent most of his working years in his ivory towers , and he was pretty insulated from life . To really know life , you 've got to be part of life . You must get down and look , you must get into the , the nooks and crannies of existence there , you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is .\nTony Hitchman: And you in fact did this ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , I 've slept with bandits in Mongolia and I 've , uh , uh , hunted , uh , with , uh pygmies in the Phillipines ; as a matter of fact , I 've studied _ 21 _ , uh , different primitive races , uh , including the white race ...\nL.

It is the single greatest threat that this country has .\nHimself - Moderator: Which leads to my next question , as we enter our last segment here the subject of securing America . On nuclear weapons , President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation 's longstanding policy on first use . Do you support the current policy ? Mr. Trump , you have two minutes on that .\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I have to say that , you know , for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia , she 's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries . But Russia has been expanding their - they have a much newer capability than we do . We have not been updating from the new standpoint . I looked the other night . I was seeing B-52s , they 're old enough that your father , your grandfather could be flying them . We are not - we are not keeping up with other countries . I would like everybody to end it , just get rid of it . But I would certainly not do first strike . I think that once the nuclear alternative happens , it 's over . At the same time , we have to be prepared . I ca n't take anything off the table . Because you look at some of these countries , you look at North Korea , we 're doing nothing there . China should solve that problem for us . China should go into North Korea . China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea . And by the way , another _ one _ powerful is the worst deal I think I 've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal . Iran is one of their biggest trading partners . Iran has power over North Korea . And when they made that horrible deal with Iran , they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea . And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places . And when asked to Secretary Kerry , why did n't you do that ? Why did n't you add other things into the deal ? One of the great giveaways of all time , of all time , including $ 400 million in cash . Nobody 's ever seen that before . That turned out to be wrong . It was actually $ 1.7 billion in cash , obviously , I guess for the hostages . It certainly looks that way . So you say to yourself , why did n't they make the right deal ? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history . The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems . All they have to do is sit back 10 years , and they do n't have to do much .",

It 's gon na be a long time before he can approach a relationship with a woman with any degree of confidence . But , Will , he came to us because he was troubled and all he ask is what 's wrong with me and everything he says leads to the same question : What is a man ?\nDr. William Raymer: Well if you saying the boy 's problem is n't homosexuality , what is it ?\nDr. McKinley Thompson: I 've lived through it and so have you ... and so has every American male over _ fourteen _ . You sit around in a barracks or in a vacant lot or on the job and every man there takes turns telling their adventures with the girls . Now each one knows that he 's lying but he thinks he 's the only one and everybody wonders . Everybody has the nagging feeling that he 's not living up to the great American male image . The great Western hero : strong , silent , half - Neanderthal man , half - Don Juan . Now in this concept of a man there 's no room for tenderness or understanding of other people , no place for sensitivity or aesthetic feelings . All that is considered feminine . Sure , with this boy 's family situation and his Army history , he 's obsessed with masculinity . He 's afraid of failing with a woman and maybe he will . The rest of us have worked out the answer to Paul 's question one way or the other . He hasn't found it yet . Of course , there are those easy answers and Paul can get those from his brother Murray . But what 's the truth ? Before we judge him , before we let him accept his own diagnosis , maybe we ought to examine the question ourselves : what is a man ?",
