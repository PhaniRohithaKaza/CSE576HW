If rape is a 10, and peeing outside were a 1 (without a minor present), I wonder where this might fall. The woman obviously had to be skeeved out, and has her person violated in a clear way, but I doubt even she would rank it a 10?",

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

People still laughed so then they started endorsing Dems 3 at a time to get the daily drumbeat of professional facade over ASAP. Then they announced they would no longer endorse anyone, figuring Dems were a lock in Boulder anyway. But ridicule is a funny thing. Finally, this last year the Camera found the ultimate solution- they just disabled ALL comments.

Drinking, smoking, drugs, overeating, lack of exercise, and extramarital sex contribute greatly to 9 of the 10 most costly areas of medical expense, over $1 Trillion, and we want others to pay for it.

On the other hand, if rats keep deserting the doomed ship, at a certain point this administration will fall apart from attrition.

I went to college in the 1970s and if an actual crime was committed it was not overlooked. But if a guy pinched a girl (or vice versa) or something like that, it wasn't made into a statistic. Come on, women, you haven't progressed any more than this? Tsk tsk.",

Their employers control who gets access to the media and typically provides media training on what to say, and importantly, what not to say. Sometimes these rights and restrictions are spelled out in an employment contract and breaking them are grounds for dismissal. While in business, I was subject to extremely high confidentiality requirements that exist post employment.\n\nCan you imagine the chaos is every employee of the government felt they had the right to say to the public everything they were doing.

Your quotation from John Jay (JJ) correctly asserts the exact opposite.

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy. IMHO, globally the correct figure today is minimally 50%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Reliable data is virtually impossible given the ongoing preference for the closet among priests.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

That alone took decades.   I totally agree with Pandora666 that the bishops and the larger church hierarchy should not be in charge of the fund.  Every bishop needs to pay into a fund because every bishop was  part of the problem by overtly lying about what was happening and transferring the offending priest or tacitly because they did not speak out about the travesty of justice perpetrated by our church!   Having said that, however,  I must give kudos to the Swedish church for their actions.  IMHO I believe Jesus would have done the same.  If only the wider church would look at itself for their own actions or inaction and be shamed into doing the same.",

The drug addicts who live in or are serviced by the camps are now boldly entering people's homes while they are there to rip them off.\n\nWe can't have a large population of people living completely outside society's norms and not expect that they will draw the line where we want them to. The result is rampant crime that continuously escalates. Frankly, I don't want the children of my neighborhood to grow up with bullets whizzing past them, which is now happening.\n\nAlso, we've been allowing the drug addicts to take over all of our bike paths and waterfronts.

While I doubt the perceived/actual northerly shift of harvest is solely due to climate change - legal and illegal over-fishing or illegal gear, habitat damage and pollution are all contributors to the perceived habitat shifts - but on the northwest and Alaska coasts that have not as severely damaged their resources, the population shifts & sea-life die-offs over the past couple of decades seem easier to link to our rapid Alaska climate warming.",

Project Success was a success only for those who wanted to devastate welfare.\n\nThat plan, as I documented as a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, forced women on welfare to abandon mothering their children and take low-paying jobs at places like Wal-Mart and Tyson poultry, both of which Clinton represented as a lawyer with Little Rock’s Rose Law Firm, and the program was an atrocious failure.\"",

His real sin is his honesty.  Make no mistake, statutory rape is rape regardless of consent by the victim, because the victim simply is not old enough to consent.  Milo had his first (homo)sexual encounter when he was 13 or 14 with a Catholic priest .  Thirteen or fourteen is too young to have sex -- homosexual or otherwise -- but they're doing it anyway.  Milo's politically unforgivable transgression was to explain that he was a willing participant and to describe the personal importance of the experience.\n\nHis account made me uncomfortable because it forced me to confront realities outside of my personal experience.

However, many of the tribally-enacted constitutions were boiler-plate templates, requiring Secretary of the Interior-approval for many tribal government actions.

Excessive benefits for civil servants\n3. Pension income splitting by civil servants\n4. Stock option plans treated as capital gains for senior managers\n5. Trust structures to spread the tax burden among family members and use multiple one time capital gains exemptions\n6. Agreements to allow doctors to incorporate to effectively pay an obfuscated higher wage.\n\nTo address just the small business issue is disingenuous to say the least.  \n\nBut, there was one notion  liked to identify personal corporations that are legit versus just for tax.  Doing so is a no brainier.\n\nSo, I suggest we put all this into the hopper and start again.",

The Olympics are a business and with doping and political boycotts are as impure and corrupt as they could be.

Twenty-first century Americans might find much to fault with either commander, but there's no way anyone can whitewash military success from textbooks at West Point or VMI.\n\nAnd speaking of VMI (or the nearby Washington and Lee University), perhaps either school would appreciate the donation of the statue of Robert E.

Those are troubling possibilities, because a problem that could be dealt with early on might persist or grow worse.\n\nThe \"bother\" the complainant is concerned about is, ultimately, a criminal trial where she will be the primary witness. That's a very heavy burden to take on. Again I point out that perhaps some other means of dealing with the complaint outside of the criminal justice system might make women more willing to come forward.",

That strikes me as a bit arrogant, not to mention naive.\n\nBut that's a separate issue from the belligerence of those who, today, want to wave the Confederate flag for their own political purposes. To my mind, they are part of the same social phenomenon that was reflected in the election of a demagogue to the presidency. They may be from the south, but they have ideological kinsfolk all over the country, and they aren't going away any time soon. That's the worry.",

Those protections are strong for good historical reason, and they are working.  In some respects the establishment of an Ordinariate for those of Anglican heritage was similarly motivated; per Bishop Lopes's history of the problem, diocesan officials repeatedly sabotaged previous efforts.

It's what schools--and some teachers--do with those resources that are often the problem.  There are needs, and there are wish lists.  There are must-have supplies and wouldn't-it-be-nice-supplies.  There are ways to recycle and wisely use items, and there are ways to waste items.  Another example is textbook purchasing.  In my experience, some teachers/departments took care of their textbooks, required students to protect them with paper covers, kept an inventory, and held students accountable for lost or damaged-beyond-repair books.  Others took little care of the $50 per copy books because, when they were lost, textbooks were considered a necessity and one could always get money to replace them or even buy brand new sets.  As for supplies, buying in bulk for a department or grade level from Fisher Hawaii or other suppliers does not create a HIDOE bureaucracy.",

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.

Also, sometimes an individual can sometime justify actions that would normally be considered criminal. The term \"suspect\" is appropriate until the verdict is determined. Keep in mind that when writing procedure or law, you must approach from a general view, not a specific one. If you are too specific, you will allow unintended results.\n.\nI do think that the appeals process should take into consideration the clarity of the evidence to determine the validity of appeals.

The decision to not rename Dunn Hall after Dr. Ed Coleman is a tragically missed opportunity.",

The USA could have defeated China in 1953, but instead we turned wimp all of a sudden. China! A bunch of savages with guns that couldn't shoot straight!  The UN could have completely isolated Nork but, no, we all sold our souls to the oodles of cheap Chinese slave labor, to which we are still hopelessly addicted today. And the Chi-coms absolutely forbid messing with Nork. Hell, we are even too afraid of China to recognize Taiwan as its own nation! \n\nSo, no, there will be zero attacks on Nork unless the Chi-coms allow it, and I can see no good reason, yet, why they would. Trump could probably figure out an incentive, but then we trade fear of Nork to increased fear of China. This is why no deal has ever been struck.  \n\nWe ought to say screw it and call China's bluff; but our leaders are even bigger weanies today than they were in 1953.",

If his income is in dividends from his company then it's quite low. I read elsewhere that income might be in the range of 100,000 per month.

There is a big difference. A VPSO goes through state training & is recognized & supervised & paid by the state. There are way more VPOs than VPSOs. VPOs get a lot less training, & none of it is from the state that I know of. VPOs get lower pay, & VPOs are not officially recognized by the state due to the state's  opposition to tribal sovereignty. VPOs are paid & supervised by tribal councils. VPOs have high turnover & are often very young guys. VPSOs are meant to be a career option & have longer term professionals, generally. Both jobs are very tough & involve putting yourself in danger without a gun. High stress & low pay. Lots of alcohol-fueled domestic disputes, sometimes relatives. \n\nAnd to #3, yes the booze came from Bethel, the only hub here.

The fact that no connection to Trump appears in the indictments suggests to me that the cupboard is bare.  The editorial suggests that Mueller intends to blackmail Manafort/Gates into testifying about the administration.

The Southern economy was premised on slavery and the leaders perceived, probably correctly, that the end of slavery would cause a tremendous upheavel in Southern life...both culturally and economically.  Those leaders also perceived (again, likely very correctly) that, with the election fo Abraham Lincoln and the ever-growing power of the Abolitionist movement, slavery in the U.S. was coming to an end....and likely in the near future.  Rather than seek to negotiate as favorable a transition as possible, likely including compensation for emancipated slaves, the South chose to secede.  It's no surprise that most the young men in the South chose to support secession. They were raised in the South and slavery was part of the values system of their lives.  ....and, yes, those damn Yankees were going to end slavery.  Gary Crum",

Your fallacy: overgeneralization from limited data. \nSo this is not the \"first real opportunity\" for Republicans. They have always had an opportunity. They choked. At least Trump knows how the pharmaceutical companies have bought congress and screwed us (below).\nRepublicans who vote for Trump and who are also low income will be the ones most hurt with HSA's and tax credits. \nI'll make this prediction: no plan will be affordable unless we control prices. Socialist countries that have done this have lowered prices. Sure, there will be many problems too. Choice is an illusion.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is.

Like \"save the salmon\" the late buses are the legal device used to try to get developers to step up their game for cheap, shortsighted profit gains. For a project that will loom over an older neighborhood it's presentation to concerned neighbors appeared less than honest. It's a lost opportunity for a design \"win\" for the arterial retail street that will take away amenities that already exist. \nWould it be so terrible to dig down? What is parking for the next few hopefully short years could be warehouses for retail on the block, resident storage space, or a winter farmer's market space in the next decade when there is less car dependence. In other words a different profit center than residential rent. In a building with more than 50 micro units at one point (still?) there was space for 5 bikes and no laundry facilities. How Is this good design for newcomers or nimbys?",

It included a summer retreat for Cuban refugee girls that Cuban parents sent here to get them out from under Communism; Catholic organizations took them in. The Cabrini Shine retreat was run by Catholic nuns.  I was their \"little heathen\" who lived about half a mile down the road in an old stone ranch house.  They'd call me up every time they encountered a rattlesnake, and I'd come kill it for them.

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

Pell treated a very broken survivor, John Ellis, disgracefully by throwing all the legal weight he, Pell, had at his disposal and effectively creating a situation in Australia where the Catholic Church cannot be sued in relation  to CSA.  Pell's creation of the Melbourne Response purported to help survivors, but in effect, capped compensation at a very low figure and acceptance of compensation meant that survivors had to keep silent.\n\nBishop Long has done more for the healing of survivors, just by his words, than all the sophistry and  rhetoric now being poured forth by other hierarchs at the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Child Abuse.  Bishop Long 'gets it', and I sincerely hope that speaking out does not curtail his advancement in the church.",

How about the Muslim family that escaped from a war-torn country and came to Canada to start anew? They've become Christian and love their peaceful lives. Then more people come, perhaps some they've known in the past, Now this family has become apostates to their previous religion. Or how about the Jewish family who've no representation, or Hindus, or Buddhists.\nWhen an idea has representation from only one side and not the other, it becomes illogical to even investigate in a biased direction.\nWe need true equality and freedom of speech no matter the opinion, or we all lose.",

The real questions: Why did the City provide so little guidance to partners regarding CBA funds? If the City had concerns, why did City staff fail to raise these concerns over three years as part of the CBA oversight committee?  Why are City staff now choosing to focus on unsubstantiated \"perceived\" conflicts as opposed to actual CBA project outcomes and activities?",

He made the mistake Juror 4 refers to:  he inferred that the actions were so severe that anyone would interpret them as attempted murder, but introduced no evidence that the defendant took any action that could be interpreted as attempting murder.  In deliberation, some jury members considered the inference sufficient. Others, however, pointed out that it hadn't been proven, and the jury hung  on that charge.\n\nI don't know the details of how the prosecution handled this case, and I don't know the motivation of Juror 4.

If they switched to the ACA and were required to pay 100% of the new premiums, that would have meant a substantial reduction in their gross compensation. The subsidy they receive is equivalent to the cost to the government of the federal healthcare that previously had been provided to them. The effect of the subsidy is that their gross compensation is equal to what it was before the switch to the ACA. \n\nAs a business owner or board member, I have had several instances where an employee had reason to request that they be allowed to opt out of the company-provided healthcare in order to purchase their own healthcare. We agreed and paid them what the cost of their coverage had been to the company. That was fair. Their compensation remained the same and there was no additional cost to the company.

In trying to explain to fellow non-natives just why this flamingo pole was so offensive and painful, I might compare it to flag burning or perhaps some public desecration of the Bible. I might also compare the issues of cultural appropriation to a copyright dispute. Sometimes, artistic expression, even when well-intentioned, can cause real injury. I can empathize very well with the pain and frustration of the flamingo carvers since, as an artist, I live with all kinds of limitations in regard to what I can do in the northwest coast artistic idiom.

At the same time he gave real administrative power to a new chairman who'd bankrupted his own family business and knew squat about running a utility. McKenna maintained the rate freeze for years even as the new chairman had a new conventional power plant built in his own political back yard with outlandish patronage driven cost overruns. Meanwhile a financial tourniquet was put on the previously top performing nuclear plant in the world and over time the whole outfit went to pot.

Without a subscription, there is no way to determine whether what has become the darling of conservatives with an axe to grind. There is every indication it is a novel study that has not been peer reviewed and confirmed by more recent studies. The scientist in me says it is initial research in need of followup by others.\n\nBeyond that, I've often thought this will be proven a red herring. In the absence of more definitive proof I certainly don't believe we have a serious voting problem in this country.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

However, while this is the preferred core inflation measure of the US Fed, its inflation target indicator is actually the PCEPI itself, which had a 1.7% inflation rate in April, down from 1.85% in March. Also, the US Fed also looks at another core inflation measure, the trimmed mean, whose 12-month rate of change was 1.75% in April, down from 1.8% in March.",

Example: Prostitution is an act upon the sexual appetite. Legalized prostitution reduces sexual assault, therefore sexual assault is an act on the sexual appetite. So, you think we should encourage one act (prostitution) to discourage another act (sexual assault) on the sexual appetite. Let's apply that idea. You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

If opioid maintenance is someone's only option it is almost always because, being the only option a physician has knowledge of, it is the only option made available to the patient. Neurostimulators to anti-depressants, Acupuncture, over the counter medications and many more effective long and short-term pain management options should be the first treatment plan physicians turn to when helping patients handle pain. Patients also need to understand some pain is normal and the difference between acute and chronic pain.

If the social benefits were not available, people would stop coming here en masse.\n\nBut the politicians only have ears for business, not the cries of their citizens who are footing the bill, so expect prices to go up another million like happened in Vancouver and the tax base to be further hollowed out.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of foreign students being recruited to proxy buy housing (displacing domestic applicants and taking youth jobs) are part of the problem as well.",

Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

He means appropriate for the white California settler well off community which wants no non white native in its neighborhood. The actual commerce of the north shore is the illegal drug business that was started by Cali surfer dudes back in the sixties. Now it is supplemented by vacation rentals in the properties they purchased using drug money. This traffic and environmental stuff is bogus. How about the city rooting out the drug economy as a first thing first.

Claw (as I have seen reference to your priestly vocation, but have not personally seen you confirm it):  I would like to commend you on both your wit and your candor. A church with such a sordid past naturally tries the very soul of the earnest seeker.  Like many of us, I suspect there was a point in time when the revelation of Rome's many misdeeds and imperial doctrine really hit home with you. Your ability to \"confess\" the shortcomings of Rome's imperial-styled doctrine is nothing short of refreshing. And the \"wit\" you add to this puts things in perspective and--for me at least--helps to heal some of the pain. \n\n\"We evolve,\" as you suggest, lest we go completely insane trying to fit square, antiquated pegs into round, modern holes. Evolution will be slow but the fact that change is underfoot provides comfort for some... far too slow for others, unfortunately. Meanwhile, might I suggest your authoring a book in the spirit of healing, openness and historical truth telling?",

It is good now and then to look back and celebrate our heroes. Then we must face forward again and get back to making what we do with our hands to minister God's love more powerfully than our words so the people we touch will glorify God.\n\nA few nights ago my son reminded me of the message he remembered from Doss: that God calls each of us to faithful service for Him and that we need to be faithful in doing what He calls us to do so others will be in the Kingdom.

But put a time limit on how long you'll give things to improve!\n\nMy very strong hunch, based both on difficult personal experience and from talking to other women who've had similar experiences, is that this guy is not interested in sex. Maybe the intimacy is too scary, maybe he can't perform without having a sense of newness with a partner, maybe he's really a sexless morph who just would rather not get it on very often. \n\nHe's not going to change. \nAnd most often, things will get worse, not better. \nDon't waste too much time with him, and good luck!",

Will immigration become a political issue in the future? That's a good question. It would only take a political maverick to bring the issue to the fore.

It is almost impossible to bring charges against said person because homosexuality is legal and it is therefore not a crime to label someone as a homosexual, despite the undeniable damage these labels do to the families, especially minor children. How is this right?\n \nWorse, hate speech laws when mis-applied can destroy good people.  A poignant example was the recent destruction of Verashni Pillay whose skewering  was absolutely merciless. She fought back and this week won her appeal against an earlier judgment that found her guilty of hate speech. It was now found that hate speech must include incitement to violence in order to be considered hate speech. And Verashni’s did not. Nor did Qwelane’s in my opinion. \n\nThe media is so narcissistically absorbed in its own virtue signalling of political correctness that it is now feeding on its own.",

The inability and unwillingness to budge an inch from party platforms and what \"constituents\" seem to want has led to a declared impasse.\n\nGov. Walker offers a compromise.  Like it or not, at least he sees compromise as a way through the ideological impasse.  This country is built on compromise.  (Check the history books.)\n\nSpread the pain, legislators.  Don't target the pain medicine; administer it to the entire state and we can feel the pain together.  Put a \"sunset\" clause into legislation that gets us through the current crisis and people may see that taxes/dividend cuts are not cast in stone.\n\nCompromise by using the calendar wisely: for instance, a summer-only sales tax will draw in more cash from tourist trade. Consolidate 53 school districts into one.  If Hawaii can do it, why can't we?  Raise the gasoline tax.  Create a luxury tax (exempting basic foods).",

I could see past discretions like theft when you were a teenager/young man but masturbating in public when you were 29 years old as part of your 3rd conviction for public indecency?  Your past is a reflection of your character and your multiple thefts and public masturbation convictions make it very clear to me that you are not qualified for the position you sought after.",
