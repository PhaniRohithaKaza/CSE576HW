This is doubly unfortunate because such behavior is a  discredit to an essential cause - the fight against racism. The \"history repeats itself as farce\" or \"Alice in Wonderland\" or Orwellian side shines brightly in the intent of the Head of Massey, Hugh Segal, to abolish the word \"Master\" because it reminds some people of slavery.

If they feel they need one or more assistants they would be required to justify that expense. Meet in Juneau for legislative sessions, any travel out of or back to Juneau for anything other than state approved business, medical reasons or an actual emergency is paid out of their own pocket.

Racism is now rampant in the US, because Trump and his merrie men have told the racists that it's OK to show their racism.\n\nTrump is a narcissist, a liar, a sexist, and a bigot. He knows little about the laws and history of the US, and cares less. This is not hatred, but the statement of demonstrated fact.",

Nowhere else in our country would a coal fired power plant even be considered. Legislators are viable pliable.  They react to public outcry.

The core message of atheism is that of denial of  God through Christ, without actually doing anything substantive to help the poor.\n\n2. Yes, of course there are SECULAR-based charities that do good work. But atheists have not really organized themselves into \"\"churches\", until recently -- something that would give atheism the potential to do good work as atheists.  The three monotheistic religions  (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) all emphasize helping the poor. On this point, where are the atheists? I mean, really?\n\nBack to the op-ed piece, the writer makes good points, as ideas.

As far as I know, all pain management clinics require that the patient sign a contract stating that they can be called in for a pill count at any time and must come in that same day.

Looking back on my life in the decades since then, the sexual assault had and continues to have an impact on my life, so I cannot minimize the impact on the victim in this case.  Do I feel a poor choice at 15 should prevent a young man from playing the sport (on the road to being professional) in which he excels? Maybe - not as a punishment, but as a deterrent and a pressure to change our culture.  In my case, and I'm sure this isn't unique, teenage boys seem to be excused for being \"horny\" when really they are exploiting vulnerable children.

This is a classic example of what Marie Collins was talking about – the actions not matching the words. Another example is Pope Francis’ claim that he practices zero tolerance and then refuses to dismiss 5 out of 6 Brisbane priests jailed for sexually abusing children, contrary to the request of Archbishop Coleridge and the CDF. Pope Francis has said some wonderful things about climate change, inequality and poverty, but all he can do is encourage others to act. When it comes to reforming  canon law on child sexual abuse and dismissing abusive priests, the buck stops entirely with him. He is the absolute monarch and answerable to no one.",

At \"billing,\" they simply say it's not possible to tell you what something will cost: \"We don't know what equipment they may need, or what complications might develop.\"  So, unlike any other economic transaction, the consumer incurs unknown financial responsibility for something he doesn't understand. I had a simple outpatient procedure done at Prov.  The bill was $35,000!  I was in the building less than 2 hours!  My insurance would pay $13,000 max.  I told the Prov billing office I simply wouldn't pay the rest.  \"Oh, we write off a lot,\" she said airily.",

Men, on average, spend more years of their life working (the don't take as much time off for things like raising children and they retire later).  All of this contributes, as you note, to an \"income gap\".\n\nHowever even adjusting for those two factors there is also a wage gap.  Why?  Well that comes down, at least in part, to the types of jobs that are more commonly held by men vs. the types of jobs more commonly held by women.  There are other factors though, like men are more persistent about demanding a raise from their employer.  Men likely also place a relatively higher importance on wages vs. non-wage benefits (things like health insurance) compared to women.\n\nLots of difference for lots of reasons, but it is unclear a.) IF the government SHOULD do anything and b.) what the government COULD do even if it wanted to.",

Like civil law, canon law has sets of rules that provide minimum standards of conduct, the breach of which involves punishment. A clear distinction is drawn in both systems between moral obligations and legal ones. They both have means of promulgation, interpretation and enforcement through courts.  They have systems of study and conferring of degrees. There is no need to “ban” canon law where it requires disobedience to civil law, because civil law effectively does that. If canon law requires bishops to break the civil law, they will still be punished by the civil legal system if they do. Bishop Pican in France is a good example.",

False flagging attacks like that, which is what we are talking about here, to emulate another hacker group with that much precision, without leaving a single clue about yourself, is probably impossible.\n\nSecond, intelligence agencies usually know for certain, and they figure it out by counter-attacking and monitoring these groups to the best of their ability from the inside.

The propaganda you've obviously been either listening to or reading is just that - propaganda. The governor and a select group of wealthy business people (including the owner of one of the primary news sources in our state, the ADN) have an agenda they're promoting and it's sure not in the best interests of the people in this state. What this has to do with the university and class sizes is that we simply should have not ever built a university system as vast and costly as the one we have now and it must be addressed.

He could not leave it in his account until he needed it and he had no way to stop the conversion of the capital gains in the 401K into ordinary income even though he earned them through risk and capital gain from careful investing. His brother on the other hand has been able to shelter money and convert a lot to capital gains though deferred participation in partnerships, and other devices available to him. So he and his brother took comparable risks, but the tax law favored his higher bracket brother much better. Until this hit him personally, he did not realize how big a deal this was and how much things were stacked against him even at his level.",

The majority of homeless are not mentally ill or addicts. What I observed is that the way people get along is strongly influenced by their environment they are a part of. Were you to go from town to town and from situation to situation human nature and the people you would meet may suprise you. Ther is a reason that term \"brother\" gets tossed around- it is not just washed up bum talk. Even the addicts will show a different side of themselves if a community is allowed to take root around them. THAT right there says you have not identified a true fundamental factor of causation, i.e. drugs did not cause it, rather something caused the drugs which helped cause the homeless situation. Unfortunately we live in a society where people are outside broken up or inside separated. You've spent much time and effort normalizing fitting into this reality.",

Instead he's done so much more---like throttling the EPA and reversing Obama's lock-up of Alaska . His plan to open the King Cove road putting human's lives ahead of birds was great.

I think a Trump Presidency could be even more disastrous than people think (the Frontline program I saw on TV last night on Clinton & Trump reinforced that). And, just because Johnson and Stein are \"third party\", that in itself doesn't necessarily mean they'd make a good president, though your correspondence is making me take a more in-depth look at both of them. Also, even though Clinton is a product of a corrupt political system, I don't think she is quite the \"disaster\" some people make her out to be.\n\"Back to the future we go\". I understand what you're saying, and it's a good point for which I do not have an answer.  You, me, and Trump supporters, none of us has a crystal ball.

Israel has had nuclear weapons likely since the 1950's, and despite all the fighting that's gone on between Israel and it's neighbors since then, Israel hasn't used them, to their credit. In light of that, do you believe, though, that Israel actually wants the U.S. to use tactical nuclear weapons in the region on it's behalf? That's what you're essentially stating.. Regarding Hillary and Donald, both reprehensible people, both liars, both at least in part psychopathic personalities, though their respective administrations would have differing impacts on our nation. In the broader picture both parties at the higher power levels are thoroughly broken and corrupted (which is why Trump appeals to many, because of what he isn't - an entrenched, professional politician, beholden to PAC money), but are people looking closely enough at what he is? Hillary on the other hand is just a nightmare, and stands for the worst of what a corrupted system has to offer.",

Their candidate for President is a excellent example of their message. He will lose next month. How anyone could vote for the Three Stooges we have representing us up here is beyond me? One Stooge had his seat bought by the Koch brothers and will move back to Ohio when he is out of office. The other two are up for reelection. Sadly, they will most likely win. After the election, when the House and Senate has been turned back over to the Democrats, our State will suffer because our Representatives will be in the minority.

There, specific decisions have to be made and responsibility has to be openly shouldered.  This is what too many legislators--especially Republican legislators--seem incapable of doing.\n\nThe House voted an income tax because it saw no other way to close the deficit.  Borrowing from the state savings account is sheer folly; it's like telling somebody to spend their last dime before worrying about poverty.  The state--i.e., the Republicans--stupidly decided to forego the revenues we were getting under ACES.  Now they propose no new revenue, and keep chanting about \"bloated state government,\" as if that's going to absolve them of their stupidity.",

So what happened to the mortgages that were written under false pretenses.   The problem with Home Capital isn't that their mortgage brokers wrote 'liar loans'.  The problem isn't that there is default risk or interest rate change risk in those mortgages.  The problem is that investors did not learn how many loans were taken under false pretences, and the damage to the mortgage book, if any.

Stats and claims like: \"D.V. is the leading cause of emergency room visits by women ,\" and \"95 per cent of victims of domestic violence are women.\"  The Justice Department's \"Intimate Partner Violence\" report reveals that 1/3 of total domestic violence murder victims are male.  Further, less than one per cent of females (and males) are victimized each year.  Hardly an epidemic justifying a monstrous government system and the modification of speech. Local U of O prof (Fraud?) 's numbers regarding date rape and campus sexual assaults are equally contrived and ridiculous. It's time to stop systematic violence against civil rights.

Visited the local marine supplier - the staff was not interessted in my need but tried to sell me what they had in stock - which was totally undersize and not suitable. They did not even bother to suggest ordering the unit for me, the price they quoted after much debate seemed high. Fed up I went home - on the Internet - and was able to find and order the thruster from stock, a distributor in the UK. Entered my credit card number in the order  page and the morning of the third day after the bow thruster and attendant bits were delivered to my front door by courier.

The phone acts as the amplifier and brings you the sound via the phone's earbuds. My current favorite for the iPhone is Petralex. It runs you through a hearing test and sets itself accordingly. As with hearing aids, you can have different settings for different environments. I presume there are similar apps for Android.\n\nIt isn't fashionable with the cords hanging out of your ears and it drains the phone's battery faster, but in a pinch the hearing correction is near as good as with my $2,000 Costco hearing aids.",

To my knowledge, it has never happened. Additionally, having you carrying a gun, pulling it out and responding to a madman who is firing at a crowd, doesn't make me feel safer. In fact, it makes me feel less safe because most civilians don't have the training to remain cool under fire. Even police officers make huge mistakes in stressful situations and shoot innocent people - and they've had a LOT more training under duress than most civilians. So, you can kid yourself into thinking that you are safer because you are carrying a gun - you might be, but you may also have that gun taken from you and used on you. People around you may be less safe because you might take that gun out and try to respond to a bad situation and accidentally shoot an innocent person as a result.",

The Democratic party has poured a lot of money and influence into our non-partisan races and is trying to distract from local issues by labeling us sexist if we vote for a male candidate and implying independent voters are Republicans if we don't support the women King County has chosen for us.\n\nKing County has an agenda for Bellevue.  It includes county control of homeless shelter beds and siting, and heroin injection sites.  King County and the candidates the Reporter apparently favors all want to ram the low-barrier men's shelter into Eastgate where it will remain under county control, next to a county public health facility-- KC's top choice for heroin injection sites.  Fricke, Nieuwenhuis and Yin want to explore the OMFE site, which would remain under city control and all strongly oppose KC's plan for heroin injection sites.",

All that the ruling says, at it's core, is that a dog, who can detect multiple types of illegal substances, can only 'tell' his handler that at least one of those substances is present. The dog's ability to communicate with his handler is dampened simply because the dog is just that, a dog. If narcotics dogs, in the future, can accurately demonstrate a different 'tell' for each different and distinct substance, then this ruling would have no application to those scenario.

Now as to the mechanics of how it was done, there is quite of range of thought within even the Christian community, from an absolute literal six 24-hour-day creation with a young earth, to a very old earth with guided evolution. A long-time pastor and friend teaches an old-earth timeline that can be supported from the Bible, but not all Christians would agree with him (but many would). I definitely don't believe in classic atheistic Darwinian evolution, and I don't believe the fossil record, when looked at carefully, actually supports it - Darwin was working with much less data than we have now.

How far this catering goes depends on \"enrollment management\" needs. EM is quite a complicated part of the forecasting business for hitting targets.

He trespassed on Larson's property and had physically attacked Larson. Larson made a mistake in confronting him, then chasing him. He wasn't immediately charged because of who he was, but because the circumstances didn't appear to justify charges. In fact, the matter remained before the grand jury a couple of weeks ago, three months after the incident. Police sometimes lie, but it's not pervasive.

A very simple fix that has been staring everyone in the face for years.  \n\nThis means the City does not have to go around chasing down violators as well who put up apartments in those areas zoned for single family residences.  With no insurable interest, illegal apartment renters would soon find out that they cannot get renters' insurance coverage as well.  Leaving them exposed for personal liability and total loss in case of a fire.\n\nThis simple change solves a myriad of problems, from affordable housing with thousands of units available for local residents and families, to eliminating illegal rentals to tourists and local communities.

Further, the 'no more clause' in ANILCA would not survive close examination by the courts, who have held since 1920 that large monuments are permitted, and that the size of the monument is the presidents call. Monuments in ANWR and Bristol Bay will be upheld, under Supreme Court precedent, and the fact AK has no standing to challenge any monuments in its borders , under Alaska vs Carter (1980). It is the courts, not Congress, that determine the legality of actions by the presidents, in the case of monuments, the courts have upheld every monument ever challenged, including all 17 of Carters.

And the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.\"\n\n\"So far from being a pro-privacy quotation, if anything, it's a pro-taxation and pro-defense spending quotation.\nIt means, in context, not quite the opposite of what it's almost always quoted as saying but much closer to the opposite than to the thing that people think it means.\"",

Maybe add some serious police attack dogs that can take a bite out of crime to add to the patrol.  Yes, it is about intimidation, but the bullies & troublemakers have the upper hand in Waikiki.  Also definitely want patrol cops to wear body armor, body camera & don’t hesitate to legally use whatever force necessary to stop a threat.
