On it, is a map of GB demarcating the retreat of the Grand Pacific (GP) Glacier since 1794 when Geoge Vancouver first \"discovered\" Glacier Bay (at that time a 5 mile indentation in the shoreline). In 1794 the Bay was walled off by the enormous 4000' thick and 20 mile wide GP Glacier! From 1794 to 1912 the GP Glacier retreated over 80 Miles! Since 1912 the teeny tiny remanent Grand Pacific Glacier (now 210' thick and 2 miles wide) has retreated and advanced a mear 5 - 8 Miles!

The upper dam could have been similarly drilled under to allowed the lakes to refill in flood season, protecting downstream property and then used as a reservoir in Summer. We spent millions of scarce tax dollars for the aesthetics of a \"wild\" canyon for a few tourists. Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs, which will likely have their own hazards, and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die.

In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.\n-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.\n-Corollary to the 5th Law: A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.\n\nPaul",

This state of affairs explains why in such circumstances our attempts to know what ‘the people’ really think are in vain and why, under these circumstances, this question is so irrelevant for the person who is thinking and acting responsibly. The word of the Bible that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom declares that the internal liberation of human beings to live the responsible life before God is the only genuine way to overcome stupidity.\nBut these thoughts about stupidity also offer consolation in that they utterly forbid us to consider the majority of people to be stupid in every circumstance. It really will depend on whether those in power expect more from peoples’ stupidity than from their inner independence and wisdom.\"\n- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, from ‘After Ten Years’ in Letters and Papers from Prison (Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works/English, vol. 8) Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2010.

Souki is Speaker of the house and Baker, Keith-Aragan, McKelvey, Woodson, Ing all chair committees. DeCoite, English are vice chairs (English had been a chair last session). \n\nThe neighbor islands are getting the prime cuts when it comes to funding needed projects, and we on Oahu pay 80% of state income and regular GE taxes but our problems are neglected.  The skim is the cherry on top of Souki's sundae of power.\n\nWhy?  Because Oahu democrats, who have the votes to take back leadership on behalf of their constituents, are divided and conquered.

The result is that if \"more regulations\" are put in place, they ossify and it often takes decades to get rid of them after it's clear that they are a mistake.\n\nMarijuana prohibition itself is a horrible example. It was done by regulation without any debate or examination of the (lack of) scientific evidence to support prohibition; fifty years after the fact, the LeDain Commission recognized that prohibition was a mistake, and more than forty years after that we are finally moving to legalize. In other words, we had a bad regulation in 1923 and by the time we're rid of it, 95 years has passed.",

The child survived, but the mother died in this sacrificial act of saving her child.  This image in my mind, helped me to understand that yes, Jesus yielded fully to God's Will to bring us mercy, forgiveness, of sins at a great cost.

Ordination was a prayer that this person be strengthened by the Spirit to put this [Spirit-given] gift at the service of the community.\n\nSo I believe \"... with your spirit\" was not just a recognition of ordination, but the people affirming why they chose this person to be ordained to be the presider at their Eucharist.\n\nSo I say, yes by all means ask the people to respond \"And with your Spirit\" ... but FIRST restore the ancient tradition of the people choosing their candidate for ordination.

HART has money in their budget for an audit, then the Board nixes the audit.  I understand that the City auditor has already conducted an audit and the FTA has also conducted numerous peer reviews, but, the community has yet to get a reasonable explanation as to how and why costs have skyrocketed.  Further the denial of the audit adds to the perception that HART has something to hide.  Its getting harder for rail supports to continue their support in light of HART's actions, and I have a hard time believing that the legislature will actually approve a GE tax exemption if there are no assurances that the audit will be conducted.  Heck given HART's action the legislature could simply throw the hot potato back to the City and say pay for the rest of the system out of property taxes.",

As you know sexual intercourse is not illegal.  A rape kit tells whether sexual intercourse has occurred and via DNA the male involved.  But if a DA determines that circumstances do not support rape but rather consensual sex, the rape kit provides no useful information.

About 2007 I gave evidence in Ireland to the Ryan Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, as part of the group “Let Our Voices Emerge” which represented persons falsely accused of abuse.  We stressed that leading members of FOUR different “Victims'” groups had made clearly false allegations against the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy e.g. that they had murdered children in their care. Some of these murder allegations related to periods when no child died of ANY cause (so these are lies rather than delusions.)  I coined the phrases “Murder of the Undead” and “Victimless Murders” re these claims. A version of documentation that I gave to the Commission can be seen here:\nhttp://www.irishsalem.com/irish-controversies/allegations-of-child-killing-1996to2005/SunTribune25May06.php\n\nNone of the \"Victim\" leaders who made preposterous claims resigned, which must also say a lot about the credibility of the ordinary members of the groups!",

She also said,\"Fewer than 10 percent of criminal cases filed in Lane County go to trial\", which means prosecutors only have to have sufficient evidence to scare the defendant into taking a plea deal.

Also keep in mind many, many teen suicides do not make the news. There's one from this week that is nearby, outside LPS, but unmentioned. A girl who sat next to my son in class committed suicide 3 years ago, and it was told to the students, but there was no press.

Kaepernick was in the top 25 last year. Paxton Lynch was not. Blaine Gabbert was not. Brian Hoyer was not. All three have NFL jobs, Hoyer with Kaepernick's former team and Gabbert after being replaced by Kaepernick. Heck, even Eli Manning was not, and Cam Newton checks at right at No. 25.\n\nThere are a number of factors at play in each case, chiefly with Lynch that he didn't play as much as Kaepernick did.\n\nSo it's clear not only Kaepernick's play that is keeping him unsigned. Those \"controversial antics\" were joined by other players who are also still employed. Brandon Marshall of the Broncos for one.",

I believe local grassroots efforts are the path to resilience and good health.  Implementing decentralized energy and agriculture is key.  Bioregionalism is key.  Sourcing basic necessities close to home. Protecting our ecosystems and their basic services.  We are headed towards mass species extinction due to global warming, human population explosion, toxic chemicals, factory farming, etc. and it should be \"all hands on deck\" to mitigate and change this course.

The reason is a little complicated; I'm sorry not everything is perfectly simple, but the short version looks like this.\n\nEveryone pays taxes.  Most road maintenance money in Oregon comes from the general fund, which most of us pay into through income and/or property taxes.  Some comes from auto registration and licensing; most who ride bicycles pay for that as well (fully car-free people are, even in Portland, a rarity).  Some comes from gas tax; that's paid by drivers of gas or diesel cars (but not electric cars), long-haul truckers, etc.  The amount that last generates is more than offset by the reduced road wear when a car owner rides a bicycle instead of driving.\n\nThere's a myth of \"road tax\" paying for the roads, but it's just that - myth.

I don’t know anyone who would contest that the Church has taught that capital punishment is allowed in some cases. We also teach that Jesus was a victim of capital punishment. It is not hard to imagine that Jesus on the Cross might inspire the Church to repudiate the way he was killed, ie oppose capital punishment. This would change Church teaching on capital punishment because there is an implicit conflict that has not yet been resolved. Development would lead to abrogation of “settled” teaching. \nThat has not happened yet, and may never, but I am pretty sure Newman allowed for that type of change.",

While you believe there should be no outside cats at all, it’s not realistic. There are always going to be some outdoor cats.

Our second Miata was sideswiped by a mid size car, and suffered only superficial damages, the front end of the other car required major structural and body work.\nThe electric sun roof, is also a great addition.   Spacious, reasonably quiet, and easy to operate, without loss of trunk nor cabin space.  Look for later model Miata's for this feature.\nWe drove a Z-4, and found it to be a guy's car, too long in the front and too manly in appearance.  Yes it does have a slight edge in performance, but at several costs, besides, what is the purpose of this car to be?  If it's a replacement (sic) for your father's MGB, the Miata is the modern day MGB.",

There was a time when that wasn't so, but that time passed in the 1970s. You may not recognize that if you only hang out with the race you consider yourself to be a part of, but for those of us who are happy travelers across the lines that separate us, racism hasn't been a widespread white problem in 30+ years.

I do not see every white Trump voter as a racist, or a nationalist, and anti immigration.

What I hope they begin to understand is that the Southern Baptist Convention has used cultural issues to hide their racism.  So in effect pro life Catholics enabled Southern racism and the rise of the Alt Right.  I didn't vote for President and am getting sick of pointing out to Trump voters that Trump did not win the popular vote.  He won the Electoral College by some 70,000 votes.  It is indicative of his narcissism that he can't handle the loss of the popular vote and yet it is equally indicative of many of his supporters that they can't handle that fact either.  Trump is a disaster and no amount of Rogue Catholic defending is going to change that fact.",

The performance of their mortgage portfolio was strong and the company had completed another clean audit.\n\nDid the executives make a mistake in waiting to disclose? I think they did, but they were also advised that their disclosure was adequate by two accounting firms and a law office. These issues are hardly black and white and for the most part the G&M has passed judgement on the issue.\n\nAll the OSC did here was pour gasoline on a fire that was almost over and destroyed a company almost overnight.

You assume there is a true liberty for two gays to marry.  There isn't --- short of perverting the Constitution beyond recognition, which the Supreme Court did.  Reasonable people can, and do, dispute the \"liberty\" of gay marriage.  It does not seriously meet their argument to say, \"Then don't marry someone of the same sex.\"  That doesn't meet their reasonable objection, which is that marriage has always meant the union of people of the opposite sex.  If your post were serious, you would not have proposed as a solution something that doesn't resolve the objections one iota.  And if you think your first \"solution\" was \"serious,\" you don't understand the objection.\n\n\"No-one\" is sloppy and non-standard.",

Back about15 years ago when the environmentalist sued nmfs about stellar sealions, they never did figure out why they were declining and just closed down a lot of ocean to fishing. Those sealions have declined more & haven't rebounded yet little effort is made to why. Scientists need the council to allocate dollars but it seems this council would rather stand back and watch",

That pension system is underfunded by $12 billion.  It's a big number, but it's still a very optimistic estimate because it assumes that the $15 billion in assets of the pension system can be invested at a 7% return in investments.  Recently, however, the return was a negative 1%.  Assuming a more realistic 2% over the course of many years, the pension fund would be underfunded by $35 billion, and not $15 billion.

Wathen's solution to the affordable housing crisis is problematic because it requires undesirable additional taxes and the conversion of precious agricultural or conservation land to be used for housing.

All land that is currently zoned for single family homes from Kahala to Kalihi should be rezoned for low rise apartments, including Kaimuki, Kapahulu, Moiliili, Manoa, Nuuanu, and Liliha.  That would create an economic incentive to increase the supply of housing, which would have the effect of driving down housing prices.  These areas would eventually look more like McCully, where small apartment buildings are mixed in with single family homes.  This solution would increase the concentration of housing on existing urbanized lands instead of destroying precious agricultural or environmental resources, and it wouldn't require any additional taxes.",

If the subject is discussed at all, we usually get a few brief slogans and platitudes, meant to gather votes in selected  jurisdictions. There is no long-term plan or foresight.  According to this simple way of thinking, having more and more people will lead to having more and more older adults who will need the support of more and more younger people and so the population should grow continuously and indefinitely.

A cornered animal experiences a surge of sudden ferocity. During its final minutes, when the animal knows it’s going to die, it will emit a specific sound, a warning to others of the same species. That sound is known as a death cry. I believe we are hearing the death cry of the G.O.P. in its current incarnation: racist obstructionists who welcomed the squalid alt-right into their midst and failed to produce a credible nominee for president. They had their chance, and blew it. They dismantled unions, systematically attacked education, and ignored the separation of church and state. They gave corporations the same rights as people while trampling the rights of actual human beings. Unlike other animals, which know the death cry as a warning, too many Americans are responding with a sense of outraged empowerment. —Chris Offutt",

If we give time lines of 10-15 years, businesses will have time to adapt to the shifts by building different types of plant, moving from coal and natural gas to solar and wind farms.\n\nThe fact is that doing nothing, which is what we are doing, is going to set up an economic nightmare. As the earth warms, some of the world's best cultivation lands will become more difficult to farm. Clean water for drinking will be reduced, forcing increased reliance on energy dependent (and with dirty power, CO2 emitting) technology. Food scarcity could become a major factor.\nFrom a national security perspective, it has a real potential to destabilize global allies, and threaten American military supremacy.

People just don't get excited about a schedule like that win or lose. That's like a D2 schedule and I recently heard that many of those same teams will return again next year and sponsors may even consider pulling out. At $26-$30 per ticket it's pathetic to make fans sit thru games like that again. Don't think for a second that the head coach is not responsible for the schedule.

The CDHRI, to which I believe over 40 Muslim-majority countries are signatories, is essentially an oppositional response to the UDHR. It sets out the 'legal' basis for Muslim exceptionalism and is seen as a mainstream approach in much of the Islamic world and presumably among many Muslims who are living in the West.

It seems to be a sin for which many do not repent.  As welcoming as God remains to you and I, despite our persistent lacks of love and repentance, that's how welcoming we are called to be.\nThis same lack of love was preached as gospel in May as we visited Boulder Co., only for physician-assisted suicide rather than gay marriage. The priest, to his credit, obviously struggled with the unloving mandate from his bishop. So we refuse to walk with those who cry for help, just like those abused by churchmen or women, just like those who dare to love, because Christ demands it?

Think of all the new construction to build grow houses. Then there are the jobs created to grow the product. Remember that we voted to make it legal. For me, it breaks my heart when I see how the oil helps children from having seizures and we fight with all of our power to keep it away from them.

Sadly, the official church needs to get its head out of its \"hidden theology\" which sees sexuality as:\n1) Only good if it leads to procreation [within marriage, of course].

So the concept of Sex only for Procreation is a false one.\n2) Degrading [as proclaimed by the Gnostic heresy back in the 2nd/3rd Centuries but accepted as discipline by the official church] diminishes a person's ability to achieve greater spiritual union with God [as though God didn't create sex and sexual pleasure].\n3) Sought by women.  Women are still [in some quarters] thought to be \"Eves\" who tempt men to sin\nand are all 'occasions of sin'.\n\nUntil that 'hidden theology' is rooted out---even courses in the seminary [which has been poor in tis area] of human biology and relationships won't help as much as it should.",

Since when does he have the power to hand write in his own amount?  Veto would have removed all of it not an amount he felt was appropriate.  Herein lies the issue.

Our population has grown substantially in the last 9 years.   The percentage of working age adults that are working now is dramatically lower.    And when one factors that many of the new jobs that have replaced old ones have been either lower in pay, or even just part time jobs that pay no benefits, the situation is actually much bleaker still.\n\nIf the economy had truly been in great shape in recent years, Donald Trump would never have been elected President.\n\nNo doubt, though, that if the economy does falter, the media will place all blame on Donald Trump.",

On the other hand, if they have multiple implementations of their work that achieved what I am looking for PLUS they're great communicators, then I'll hire them on the spot.\n\nCritical thinking is key folks. The ability to memorize something and be able to recite it back during an exam is useless in the world.

Booking the exact same fight and same day with the same carrier was just $40 more then extra 'fee' from airmiles.  Airmiles stated this was a navigation fee of $556 and was from the carrier. When I pointed out the carrier ticket costs including all fees, about $226 in taxes and fees, was just 40 more then the airmiles navigation fee they said nothing they could do because it was from the carrier. So I called the carrier. The carrier explained they do not assess this fee and the loyalty provider was basically full of it. So not only was there extra fees to 'reward' airmiles for my loyalty but I'd also have to burn a lot of points to end up saving $40 and have the frustrating experience of trying to book on their user unfriendly byzantine system . I will no longer use their points system as it is basically a fraud.",

This incident sparked multiple complaints of sexual harassment from various women around the capital. In 1994, the Senate officially censured Jacko, ending his political career, or so we thought. News about Jacko continued to fill newspaper columns and evening news spots. In 1997, Jacko was served with a protective order to stay away from a 16-year-old girl in Homer. Within two hours he was arrested for violating that order. Per the Empire, the mother of the 16-year-old claimed that Jacko was “obsessed” with her daughter. The two would often engage in long phone conversations, including one that lasted 10 hours. In 1998 he was convicted of violating the restraining order.”",

Some people aren't much for prayers, but when someone they know has passed or is in pain it is often a time for prayers. The chaplain is completely separate, they ask if the person would like them to pray with them, and often they wait until loved ones arrive on scene. Cops & EMS focus on the victims/incident. So what exactly are you referencing when you say \"Time to get rid of this much-abused program\"? Don't dismiss the purpose of a chaplain. When my daughter is surrounded by EMS and being loaded into the back of an ambulance, and I am terrified as I watch her little body convulse and eyes rolled back in ER head, I'm saying please God just let her be alright, I will gratefully take all the prayers in the world. I've spent hours in ICU rooms and just knowing that someone is there to pray and offer emotional suffer is very calming.

The smaller your young, the more rapidly they cool, the more often they need feeding. In the existent small insectivores still alive to this day, the males have much larger territories than females, again getting back to greater demands on spatial perception and geometry. And the act of males bringing adult females food to aid in steps of embryo/fetal/young development? That predates considerably the last common ancestor of mammals, being present in birds and, it is thought, dinosaurs!",

It can't.\nThe phrase \"but I say unto you\" can be found in many places in the beatitudes already mentioned above. No contradictions, rather, our Lord was explaining scripture to Israel for our learning.\nHe did that for Israel first, who rejected Him. He did that for us later, and today, through His chosen apostle St. Paul. He opens up scripture, not contradicts it. For us (Luke 24:30-32) through the breaking of bread.\nBut, it's good to search seeming contradictions as there is learning there. Thanks!",

A person bringing a false accusation should be held accountable for doing so. The bishop can go back to contemplating his known failures, if he is morally mature now enough to do so. If he was assigned to the parishes cited, or had some other close connection to them,  then he has lied, and the investigation should continue.

About half an hour later, we noticed the temperature was much cooler (even though we were still at what should have been the heat of the day). Our host again looked at the thermometer and it was about a dozen degrees cooler, all simply because the AC's were no longer heating up the neighborhood.

Securitas should subpoaena all media interviews she made and present her changing story at trial, if it goes that far.   For example she admitted the dog broke loose and she did NOT have control of her pitbul in an off limits area of the ariport that  has many people and children around.  Once she lost control of her pitbull she is automatically wrong.  Now her story is she regained control of her pit bull before the security officer shot the dog.  All I know if she sues in court and loses, Securitas should demand she and her family pay all court and health care costs to Securitas and the officer.  If Espero is so upset he should also demand HGEA no longer represent DLNR security officers after Ethan Ferguson, son of HGEA president Jackie Ferguson Miyamoto & fired by HPD; after getting convicted of rape of a minor on the job.",
