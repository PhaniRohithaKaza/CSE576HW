It travels 60 feet 6 inches from the pitcher 's mound to home - and it can cover that distance at nearly 100 miles an hour . Along the way it can be made to twist , spin , curve , wobble , rise , or fall away . The bat is made of turned ash , less than 42 inches long , not more than 2 3/4 inches in diameter . The batter has only a few thousandths of a second to decide to hit the ball . And yet the men who fail seven times out of ten are considered the game 's greatest heroes . It is played everywhere . In parks and playground and prison yards . In back alleys and farmers fields . By small children and by old men . By raw amateurs and millionare professionals . It is a leisurely game that demands blinding speed . The only game where the defense has the ball . It follows the seasons , beginning each year with the fond expectancy of springtime and ending with the hard facts of autumn . Americans have played baseball for more than 200 years , while they conquered a continent , warred with _ one _ another and with enemies abroad , struggled over labor and civil rights and the meaning of freedom . At the games 's heart lie mythic contradictions : a pastoral game , born in crowded cities ; an exhilarating democratic sport that tolerates cheating and has excluded as many as it has included ; a profoundly conservative game that sometimes manages to be years ahead of its time . It is an American odyssey that links sons and daughters to father and grandfathers . And it reflects a host of age - old American tensions : between workers and owners , scandal and reform , the individual and the collective . It is a haunted game , where each player is measured by the ghosts of those who have gone before . Most of all , it is about time and timelessness , speed and grace , failure and loss , imperishable hope , and coming home .",

He harbors envy of and hatred toward people of a higher social class . He feels invisible around them .\nDr. Spencer Reid: Uh , class is the theme of the poem which he left at the various crime scenes .

Why he needed to make sure all his crimes were counted . His victims , they represent whatever it is that 's controlling him , and he wants that control back . He is under the thumb of a powerful woman who frightens him .

If you 're not leaving any witnesses , why wear a ski mask ?\nDerek Morgan: And he wants the victims to see him anyway .\nAaron \"Hotch\" Hotchner: Your attempted rapist is a garden - variety , disorganized young man .\nElle Greenaway: As the victim 's age goes up , generally the attacker 's age goes down .

Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what 's going on . Now , look , we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression . And believe me : We 're in a bubble right now . And the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down . We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble . And we better be awfully careful . And we have a Fed that 's doing political things . This Janet Yellen of the Fed . The Fed is doing political - by keeping the interest rates at this level . And believe me : The day Obama goes off , and he leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen , because the Fed is not doing their job . The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump , we 're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay , yet you have not released your tax returns . And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to - who he owes it to and any business conflicts . Do n't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest ?\nHimself - Candidate: I do n't mind releasing - I 'm under a routine audit . And it 'll be released . And - as soon as the audit 's finished , it will be released . But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have . It shows income - in fact , the income - I just looked today - the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million . If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago , I would have been very surprised . But that 's the kind of thinking that our country needs . When we have a country that 's doing so badly , that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world , it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs , because everybody - Lester , we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year . You know what that is ? That means , who 's negotiating these trade deals ? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals .\nHimself - Moderator: The IRS says an audit ...\nHimself - Candidate: Excuse me .\nHimself - Moderator: ... of your taxes - you 're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit . And so the question , does the public 's right to know outweigh your personal ...\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I told you , I will release them as soon as the audit . Look , I 've been under audit almost for 15 years . I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited . I said , do you get audited ? I get audited almost every year . And in a way , I should be complaining . I 'm not even complaining . I do n't mind it . It 's almost become a way of life . I get audited by the IRS . But other people do n't . I will say this . We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of . I will release my tax returns - against my lawyer 's wishes - when she releases her 33000 e - mails that have been deleted . As soon as she releases them , I will release . I will release my tax returns . And that 's against - my lawyers , they say , \" Do n't do it . \" I will tell you this . No - in fact , watching shows , they 're reading the papers . Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete . When the audit 's complete , I 'll do it . But I would go against them if she releases her e - mails .\nHimself - Moderator: So it 's negotiable ?\nHimself - Candidate: It 's not negotiable , no . Let her release the e - mails . Why did she delete 33000 ...\nHimself - Moderator: Well , I 'll let her answer that . But let me just admonish the audience one more time . There was an agreement . We did ask you to be silent , so it would be helpful for us . Secretary Clinton ?\nHerself - Candidate: Well , I think you 've seen another example of bait - and- switch here . For 40 years , everyone running for president has released their tax returns . You can go and see nearly , I think , _ 39 _ , 40 years of our tax returns , but everyone has done it . We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you 're under audit . So you 've got to ask yourself , why wo n't he release his tax returns ? And I think there may be a couple of reasons . First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is . Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be . Third , we do n't know all of his business dealings , but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks . Or maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes , because the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license , and they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax .\nHimself - Candidate: That makes me smart .\nHerself - Candidate: So if he 's paid zero , that means zero for troops , zero for vets , zero for schools or health . And I think probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are , because it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide . And the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate . They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would . And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see . And I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns , because there 's something he 's hiding . And we 'll guess . We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding . But I think the question is , were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ? Who does he owe money to ? Well , he owes you the answers to that , and he should provide them .",
