Investors in many companies never get dividends and a capital gain return is only received when stock involved is sold.  With the stock market fluctuations, one never knows whether one will achieve a capital gain (i.e. make money) or loss (i.e. lose money) when stock is sold.  Presently, investors pay tax when the deal is done, i.e. they know how much they have made.  Dividends if any are already taxed when they are received.

The problem is the bosses do NOT see two equal choices. They see one cheap and crap choice and one expensive but great choice - and are willing to pay a premium for the choice they perceive to be off higher quality.\nThe paygap isn't just prove OF sexism, it's a direct RESULT of sexism.",

Emerson reminds us that in the US there is a  religion apiece, a myth a piece. Each person is free to believe whatever he or she wants to believe.

I have never had an issue with the frequency of the buses - the 13 route is once an hour (I think an extra one comes around between 8 and 9am). I don't really see how this system is better if it potentially involves more walking, especially in a cold-climate city like Anchorage.

A government clerk in Tampa, Fla., refused to marry an 11-year-old, even though this was legal in the state, so the wedding party went to nearby Pinellas County, where the clerk issued a marriage license.

The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner. \n\nOn average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

As the Zapruder film shows that JFK did not turn around, this is inconsistent with this shot coming from the TSD.\nOther Dallas doctors later described a large exit wound at the right rear of JFK's head.  Also, the \"magic bullet\" theory is simply not credible.\nMany eyewitnesses thought that at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll.

There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.   I think that Islam is a stupid and barbaric religion forever frozen in 7th century violence.  If I said this in a Muslim country I would be murdered.

I think it more likely that you would keep working, but enjoy greater leverage to secure good working conditions for yourself.

I'm pushing to stop the project at the Kalihi Middle Street bus terminal, get it up and running to there and then see how well it operates, what it's costing, and then consider extending it to Ala Moana -- or not. Getting this leg operative would get at least some of the traffic off our roads. If it's done right, that leg could become an \"E Ticket\" for visitors to enjoy the magnificent views and many Ewa attractions. - Scott Foster",

Most builders sell the property off either to individuals or to another owner who rents it out thus  the theory, mostly of the left, is that builders don't care about \"life-cycle cost\" they only care about up front cost which would mean things like green roofs and solar panels don't get built.  I think that shows a nieve lack of understanding as any competent buyer would study the O&M (Operations and Maintenance) costs and take those life-cycle costs into account which would of course influence their offer price to purchase the property so that builders, in fact, do have an incentive to do things like green roofs.",

They purposefully register ships in foreign ports so they can avoid paying US income taxes on the vast majority of their income.  Carnival, the world's largest line (~50% of the market,) has been paying at a 1-1.5% tax rate for years, even though the corporate headquarters is in Miami for decades.  (2) Size matters. Dealing with the aftermath of a problem with a cruise ship crossing the Arctic will cost a fortune and they won't be canceling this trip because they know a storm is coming.  If the weather turns sour, a fishing vessel usually heads back to port.  I'm not saying they shouldn't go, but they should pay into some kind of insurance that will cover the cost of a serious problem.",

Overfishing is a problem. Aquaponics is a solution, but that requires power to circulate and in some cases cool the water. We get fish for protein and vegetables for carbs, fiber and vitamins, all from a highly efficient closed system. You can do this at home, but it will be done more efficiently at large scale. The power is available to do all we need for as long as we need, but simply comes at a cost greater than the fossil fuel still abundantly available, which is partly why we continue to use it.

She didn't call white people bullies, she simply explained that the black perspective of Apartheid is like having your bicycle taken away by a bully, and when your parents intervene, instead of chastising the bully, they tell you that you have to share the bike with him.\n\nWhich, to me, is a pretty on-the-nose description of how white people came out of the Apartheid era, and should really give a clearer picture as to why many black people are still angry about things, 25 years later.\n\nBut typically, instead of having a meaningful conversation about racial politics and the Apartheid legacy, white listeners immediately tried to bully the station by threatening to withdraw listenership and advertising money, without even the slightest hint of irony!",

If you review pictures from the Middle East, back around the 1900's you will notice most females did not wear these outfits. Some Muslim countries ban facial coverings. I understand the burka originated in Afghanistan before AD to control the movement of females who were treated as property, sold and traded.  The burka in the hilling rocky areas prevented the female from seeing and running away. Why would anyone continue such a repressive dress code? In my opinion, Muslims wearing any face coverings are making a political statement not a religious statement.

Don't be so insulting to a man whom was considered by many to be a highly intelligent person of his time. And what he said, was a common belief among white people in both south and in the north. Not even Lincoln believes that the black race as a whole, was anywhere close to being equal to the white. South went to war to preserves slavery. North went to war to preserves the Union. During the middle of the war when the North realized that only way totally defeat the south was to end slavery, they added that to their list of things to do. Confederate flag  today, represent the xenophobic expression of many whites who still embraced it. Your lack of knowledge about the flag you so desperately want to defend, is sorely obvious.",

We also have the derivative that divorced and remarried Catholics cannot receive communion.

We now know that to be false.  A church dating itself \nwell back about two millennium is much worse and cannot grow along with an increase in knowledge.

Agencies tell people to wait until the bear shows signs of aggression or charges. 4.

As a religion, it's closer to Buddhism than anything else.\n\nScientology is first and foremost a PHILOSOPHY. It's a philosophy that deals with YOU and what YOU are is a spiritual being.

We make all kinds of excuses for this poison to continue abusing it. It relaxes us, it makes us more interesting, it's our way of dealing with stress.....yeah right. It actually doesn't do any of these things. It's all an illusion. \n\nIf you have a problem with drinking and are having a hard time with it, read Allan Carr's book \"Stop Drinking Now\" and prepare to have all of your perceptions about the effects of alcohol and quitting alcohol changed for good. \n\nWillpower doesn't work when it comes to quitting drinking. This is because you think you're giving up a friend, instead of your greatest enemy. Changing your perceptions about alcohol and the damage it's doing to your life changes everything. \n\nRead the book!!",

He disagreed with the arguments used to challenge Khadr's right to obtain compensation for his travails but he was equally clear that it's entirely fair to argue that the matter should have been resolved in the courts rather than by settlement. The settlement does absolutely nothing to clarify or enhance the Charter rights of Canadians. It generates no case law or legal precedents upon which others can rely when their rights have been violated. And as for the economic argument (i.e. 'it was cheaper to settle'), there is often a cost to be paid to pursue justice. Interestingly, Lib politicians fought the extension of Charter rights to LGBTQ persons all the way to the Supreme Court on more than one occasion (and lost), at great expense to all concerned. The Libs are no Charter lovers and don't mind spending tax dollars in the cause of limiting the rights of some Canadians.",

Or significant work to retrofit. In a typical house, your furnace and A/C, major appliances, TVs, lights, garage door opener, sump pump, power tools, kitchen tools, etc etc would all need to be replaced or retrofitted. That's a huge expense. Much easier are the things that have an external transformer (cell phones, laptop, etc) where you'd only have to replace the transformer.  \n\nIn the long run, conversion to DC may make sense, but the transition would present huge problems. Each house might need to install a DC-to-AC transformer to run dual for a decade. But even running dual presents a problem because that would mean dual wiring and outlets.",

The truth is that the overwhelming majority will end up as unskilled labor. For every young woman who gets a four year degree there are ten who will be on their third pregnancy by the time they are 19. For every young man who earns an engineering degree there are a dozen who join gangs. What we can expect from these youth (ages up to 30) is shown in their demonstrations where they do not plead for a chance at a better life, but DEMAND some imagined right to invade this nation and live off the taxpayers generosity. They and their advocates militant approach is not winning a lot of support. I agree with those who say that letting this generation stay ensures another wave of invaders.",

There is nothing wrong with being asexual.  It is not an insult.  What is wrong is for them, from the time of the stoics, to take their natural reaction to sex and call it natural law.  No, being faithful to your wife is not asexuality, that is being true to yourself.  The problem is not my logic, but your sexual ignorance and the lack of self-awareness among asexual clergy.  Asexuality gave us sacred continence and the Platonic view of sexual love as being a secondary form of love.  Had the asexuals of that era been self-aware, most of the errors of Catholic sexual teaching would have been avoided.",

A professor who requested people to send him consecrated hosts was not strongly condemned, but those who desecrate Muslim sacred things are.  A professor has his students draw a picture of Jesus and tells them to stomp on it and nothing happens to him.

When the school systems started No Child Left Behind they started teaching not so the kids can learn what they needed to know but because the schools didn't want to lose funding or get shut down. I don't blame the teachers because they got hamstrung by the government which kept them from teaching things kids needed to know in the way that they wanted to teach them.\n\nThen there was the common core and then the everyday math, both of which taught math in the most ridiculous ways ever. I couldn't figure out why they just didn't teach the subjects in a way that would bridge to college. I told my husband that kids were eventually going to get to college and they'll have no idea what is going on because they way they teach math & such in college is nothing like what they learned in school. Math would almost be a foreign language to them.\n\nWell, here it is. Welcome to it",

We need a fair shake.\n\nAddressing our economic needs is a critical but unrealistic goal from weak knee legislators and greedy industries.  Our tax credits and reduced tax policies reward companies that lay off Alaskan workers and reduce in-state expenditures. I would call these companies poor economic friends and neighbors. \n\nI do agree with many of your points for increasing revenues.  \n\nAs to the reduced Permanent Fund Dividend, how about a trade off in state land for Alaskans?

I don't agree that it is the single greatest issue facing our nation.\n\nUnlike domestic economic issues where it might be argued Trump's business background (checkered as it is) could have prepared him for that, he has zero experience that would prepare him for either international diplomacy nor international military conflict.  But I think the biggest issue facing the future of our nation is the abyssal polarization of our political dialog.  It has paralyzed us, and unlike the late 60s during the Hawks and Doves era, it is now fueled by massive misinformation on both sides, on the left by the \"lying MSM\" but as much on the right by similar nationalist propaganda.",

Yesterday, the ERRE committee did that with a 400-odd page report making recommendations for PR and a referendum.  But that was not the answer that the Minister Monsef was looking for and so she said \"not good enough\", which was rather insulting.  I believe she has also said there's no consensus.  There's some kind of hidden agenda that she is trying to protect.  So, until the Prime Minister decides to keep his election promise, FPTP it is.  We'll likely get to a PR system eventually, but I don't think you can attribute the success of a country purely by its voting system.

Tricked by the political rhetoric of the illusionary funding for black-oriented social programs, he turns his anger to race - when he himself is the victim of class prejudice.\"\n\n\"[He] has worked hard all his life to become a 'good American;' he and his sons have fought on every battlefield - then he is made fun of because he likes the flag. The (code word) American is overtaxed and underserved at every level of government. He does not have fancy lawyers or expensive lobbyists getting him tax breaks on his income.\"",

It is just a glorified unemployment insurance scheme because it claws back fifty cents of every dollar earned by employed recipients. Like unemployment insurance and other welfare programs this claw-back provision is what destroys the incentive to work.  With universal basic income EVERY citizen receives a monthly check.  There is no means testing. Because there is no means testing there are few administrative costs.  Also, because payments are not affected by employment income, everyone still has a strong incentive to work and better their lot in life.  Keep in mind that universal basic income would replace all forms of welfare including unemployment insurance and old age security. The savings to government would be huge. More importantly UBI is a way for lower income workers to maintain dignity and self-respect.  Artists would be free to do their thing.  Crime is likely to fall.  UBI could solve a lot of problems..",

But it is less obvious nationalization was chosen in most cases--unless, of course, you are referring to rural electrification and the federal creation of non-profit entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).  \n\nBut my impression is rural electrification was achieved by creation of many of the larger, and most of the smaller, non-profit customer-owned electric utility co-ops on the mainland, predecessors to the 14-year old Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, and possibly future co-ops or non-profit taxpayer-owned utilities on the Big island and in Maui County-cont",

In the 1950's Father Fitzgerald had helped found the Order of the Paracletes. This order treated priests, nuns and other religious who were suffering from alcohol and drug addictions and other psychological problems. By the end of the fifties and into the early sixties, Bishops from across the country were sending their problem priests{ pedophile priests] to the treatment center in New Mexico. After attempting to treat these problem priests for several years, Father Fitzgerald came to the conclusion that pedophilia was not treatable. He had gone to his superiors who ignored him.",

In the 1980's the \"fund\", which had no money in it, was abolished.\n\nUnder Chretien's Liberals the EI tax (and, to be clear, Canada's EI is very definitely a tax and NOT an employment insurance program) was kept artificially high while benefits were slashed.  The result was that the tax brought in far more revenue than the social programs loosely attached to it, but as with all taxes the money just goes into general revenue.  There was a paper calculation of how much money would be in an \"EI Fund\" if such a fund were to exist, but there was never so much as a dime in any such fund.",

By taking steps to reduce the number of pedestrians and cyclists, such as building dangerous door-zone bike lanes and putting up beg-buttons for pedestrians, we should have seen a reduction in deaths, or so goes the cars-first mantra.\n\nUnfortunately, reality doesn't work that way. Under unlicensed traffic engineer Tom Larsen, we saw an unchanging number of deaths with a constant 50% of them being vulnerable road users in spite of a dramatic 37% decline in cycling. The bottom line is that motorists breaking the law are the cause of death and injury on our roads. The reasons they break the law aren't relevant, but they all get back to our lack of law enforcement that allows motorists to develop those dangerous habits like not paying attention and speeding.",

Of all the names for Charles Wohlforth to bring up on a story like this, he picked one of the worst offenders to do so. I suppose if Charles Meach was still alive, Charles Wohlforth would advocate his name as well, eh?  From what I read, clemency is granted by the governor at his or her discretion. Present governor, Walker, do have to the power to act on it....or not. So far, from 2007, governors of Alaska have not act on it and there is no law forcing them to do so is there? So if you are the governor and you don't want to give out any kind of clemency or pardon to anyone, why would you waste money going through the process???  Mr. Wohlforth is a strong supporter of SB91 and I guess he hate to see anyone behind bars.",

If/when Atheists pretend to counter Theists I think they should at least know what they are talking about before they knock some one else's perspective. And that is what I've seen on many occasions too. I also hold Science to the same standard. Take for instance the concept of solidity or particalness. When you get into Quantum Mechanics you find out solidity to be more about a system of change that repeats itself over and over so quickly for all intent and purpose it simulates solidity but bottom line nothing is solid.

For instance, I'm sure it is illegal to walk or jog in and on-street bike lane, but legal on an off-street bike path. \nCase in point: there are many joggers and even an entire running club that regularly uses the bike lane on Kalakaua through Kapiolani Park for running.

Mandated coverage provisions also affected all health insurance offered in the US, including the Hawaii Prepaid Healthcare Law which provided Hawaii residents the best coverage of any state, and resulted in 50% to 100% increases for Hawaii residents.\n\nWorse of all, Hawaii workers (especially union families) were expected to ante up to pay for Obamacare with a \"Cadillac Tax\" on overly generous benefits.

In 1970 a university degree was not yet considered a sine qua non for a good job and a good life, you could get that with just a high school degree or a trade or in business, and many immigrants came from peasant cultures that did not value education.\n\nToday with educational inflation, a B.A. is the equivalent of a high school or trade diploma then, and immigrants today are educated and value education for their children.\n\nNot to say university should not be free or at least cheaper, but that is not the main factor. You still have segments of society that have not gotten the message and do not raise their kids in view of a university education.\n\nAnd the greater issue imo is that there will always be a large segment that is just not university material, Germany for example recognizes that and offers alternatives.",

And that is exactly a subset of homosexual behavior. Likewise, if an adult had tendencies towards children of opposite gender, the heterosexual classification still applies. Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism. Also, the function of marriage between one man and one woman. That is why the homosexual act is scandalous, but isn't the worst of them.",

The biggest issue it brings to light is that we have a church whose leaders, because they do not wish to learn, make constant bad assumptions about marriage, sex, gender, & love.  \n\nStrangely, few apostles speak very deliberately in our scripture regarding sex.  St. Paul gets kudos in my opinion for stating some real truth about sex & marriage.  Many people get married because if they didn't they could not control their sexual drives and remain chaste.  This is really the only reason Paul gives for marrying in our church.  He never mentions marrying in order to make more Christians but instead to keep yourself from fornication you should marry if your will is weak.  You should love & treat each other as you would wish to be treated no matter who you marry.  \n\nThere is no allowance for homosexual marriage with St. Paul but Paul is not Jesus.

That an RCMP escort back to de Gaulle's airplane with word sent to him that he was considered persona non grata and thus ordered to remove himself from Canadian soil never took place indicates our timidity in world affairs.\nFor Americans who can't understand the fuss over this event in Canadian history, imagine if Franco didn't die but lived to visit the United States during its Bicentennial and appeared at the Alamo declaring \"Larga vida un texas libre! (Long live a free Texas)\" and then pledging Spain's support for the cause.",

One close friend grew up in an upscale Toronto neighbourhood, went to private school, went to university, got heavily into weed, dropped out and now lives in social housing getting high every day at age 50 while constantly ranting on Facebook.  There is a social cost to this. Don't diminish it because you are an addict yourself.",

There are many uncharted underwater hazards and constantly shifting summer ice, that combined, require ships to reduce speed and change course many times throughout the transit. Those '7 days' of possible saved time evaporate quickly before most ships are through the Passage.\n\nWe don't have much to be concerned about , few ships will be using the Northwest Passage as a regular cargo route, anytime soon !",
