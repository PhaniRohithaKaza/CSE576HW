Given the factors that other commentators here have mentioned, and the new EU deal (EU-28 pop. 510.1 M in 2016), while Canada may not have blunt leverage as the article suggests, our vulnerability in a trade war with the US is diminishing over time.

Pipeline companies charge tolls to ship oil or gas and those tolls are mandated by the national regulator. Doesn’t have anything to do with the price of oil (so much for your Econ 101 tutorial). Here’s some more basic economics and energy knowledge for you, when Eastern Canada imports oil via ship (tidewater) that oil is based off Brent pricing. Brent oil currently trades at a ~$7 premium to WTI. Canadian oil is landlocked due to lack of infrastructure thus trades off WTI. So we sell our oil at a discount to WTI which trades at a discount to Brent because we can’t figure out how to build a pipeline. And Eastern Canada gets screwed with higher gasoline prices because they have to import more expensive oil priced off Brent. Educate yourself on the facts vs taking G&M opionion pieces at face value.",

If the mayor and city council raises property taxes for rail construction, it's going to be more than 10% and with Hawaii's tax burden so high, we will be competing to be the state with the heaviest overall tax burden.

The reductions in insurance coverage between 2018 and 2026 would stem in large part from changes in Medicaid enrollment—because some states would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped. In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.\"",

Therefore, this article, and other people (govt and tax advisors) are not really giving the full picture here.  \nThere are two issues.  Shareholders get taxed at small business rate 12% in Alberta.  If they take out the money as dividends, they are taxed at 48% altogether.  There is a 36% deferral, money that can be left in the company to compound.  In the end, CRA will get more money, it is just deferred.  The other issue is some business owners may be treating passive investment income as business income (incorrect tax filing).  Thoughts?",

In 2016, we elected Mr. Trump. \nIn 2014 and 2015, Pope Francis gathered the bishops of the world into a synod to discuss the family, then wrote an Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, to focus our ideas and energies on divine mercy. But the divisions among us appear to grow deeper. \nI think Pope Francis has tried everything he knows to bring about change, but we and our world have become so resistant to everything but what we want to hear, it all falls on deaf ears. Being deaf, I know how that feels. Until someone comes along who can give us a new language, a way of signing perhaps, that can replace the old ways of speaking to ourselves, I don't see how any of this will change.",

Just the same as your TFSA. The part the government owns - all the original capital and the growth of it is returned to the government when money is withdrawn from your RRSP. Hence if you are in a 50% tax bracket when you withdraw any money - half of it goes to the government. More detail on this here:\n\nhttp://retailinvestor.org/RRSPmodel.html\n\nAnother error in the answer - the gentleman stated he is retired. He therefore has no earned income. Therefore he will not get a tax deduction if he contributes to his RRSP.",

Much of this does not support the idea that closing the entire area to Hawaii-based fishing vessels will serve the interests of conservation.

Democrat president Jimmy Carter also experienced something called the \"Iranian hostage crisis\" for >440 days - also quite a debacle, one would think.  :-/\n\nIn Iraq, our military took over the whole country with far fewer casualties than the number who succumbed to HIV back home in the civilian population - and Saddam Hussein and his cronies were longer a regional problem.  (Sounds like a win on at least one level.)  \n\nIt certainly is too bad that the Iraqi people lost the chance to reform their nation into a functional, pluralistic democracy - but then again, we're currently having some difficulties with that ourselves ... :(",

Lee,” D’Souza told WND. “Here’s the irony: Robert E. Lee was the most decorated soldier in the U.S. Army. He was a man of unimpeachable integrity. Lincoln offered him command of the Union Army, but Lee refused only because his loyalty was to Virginia. Lee opposed both secession and slavery.\n\n“And yet to the historically illiterate left, a man who opposed both slavery and secession has come to symbolize both slavery and secession.” - Dinesh  D'souza",

The effect was to virtually stop the construction of new purpose built rental buildings.  As I recall there was a comparison done that showed that Montreal built 10,000 new purpose built rental units in one particular year and Toronto built about 300.  The 1991 exemption was an attempt to induce builders to re-start the construction of rental units.  Essentially the government gave their word that these units would never be subject to rent control.  Ms Wynne has just broken that moral contract and in fact may have broken a legal contract.  I expect that this will end up in court.",

City administration, to a person, made a determination to recommend to the council that FSA be eliminated from what had been some of the finest drinking water on Earth but a bare majority refused and implicitly stated they knew more about their constituents than they themselves did. Code City status made that perfectly legal - but was it right? As far as initiatives go, in 2006 our group filed an initiative (signed by over TWICE as many citizens as today's petition) and what did our Code City do? They SUED their own citizens and took them to Court, where they won by 1 vote! What good are initiatives if they can sue you to stop it?.",

Sadly, that doesn't prevent histrionic speculation. But, there is something we DO know.

For a couple of hours, with Shake Shack containers littering the room, they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument.”\n\nThe plan, according to the book, was to push journalists to cover how “Russian hacking was the major unreported story of the campaign,” and it succeeded to a fare-thee-well. After the election, coverage of the Russian “collusion” story was relentless, and it helped pressure investigations and hearings on Capitol Hill and even the naming of a special counsel, which in turn has triggered virtually nonstop coverage\nShattered - excerpt in NY Post",

You can get it here:  http://www.taxpayer.com/media/73.pdf\n\nIn short, the Court ruled that no one may be held to a pre-election promise should they eventually form government.  Something about a concept of not thwarting the will of Parliament.\n\nSo, thank you Dalton, thank you so very much for bringing out in the open and making it official that ANYTHING said by an aspiring politician during an election campaign has NO LEGAL FORCE, let alone moral obligation.

So the US is to build a political symbol of limited practical consequence that hopes to stem the tide of the disadvantaged even as the US creates vastly more of the disadvantaged. That Mexico should be asked to pay for this is only logical. Why can't those Mexicans understand?

If Edgar Blatchford had won the primary I would be torn because he could take the native vote but with Metcalfe it is an easy choice for me to support an Independent who really could defeat Murkowski. Metcalfe doesn't want to campaign but he refuses to give up and throw his support to Stock who could caucus with the probable Democratic Party majority. I admire your loyalty but at this point I feel Metcalfe is using the party for vanity reasons and that is destroying any chance of flipping this Senate seat.",

Most paid no provincial tax in AB. Their money went home with them. Thousands of retirees who moved to BC from AB brought their big bank accounts with them as well. In short, AB was Cda's wealth creation machine for many yrs. And the response from places like BC and Quebec? To block pipelines and disparage AB, as many pundits did over the past several yrs. This column does the same. Look, many in AB actually support a sales tax. We get it. The deficit could be fixed overnight.

There are also many affluent people who make poor food choices.

American Christian Fundamentalism is anti-intellectual, it has a dark view of Eschatology, considers poverty to be the result of laziness and the result of sin, and is very much based on the idea of the American Dream.  This form of Christian Fundamentalism views the Bible in a Literal sense.  It is Anti-science, anti-psychology/psychiatry; frowns upon modern translations.

This study was, after all, by his own admission, the road to Damascus moment for Justin Trudeau that suddenly turned him from a leader who would balance every budget to someone promising to run “modest deficits for three years”. The PBO was requested to update the budget estimates for the Bank of Canada’s real GDP projections; otherwise it made only tiny adjustments to the DOF forecast. This turned a $1.5B surplus forecast for 2015-16 into a $1.0B deficit forecast. Trudeau took its projection of a deficit as if it were the word of God, although it wasn’t even the PBO’s best estimate, but only a constrained estimate following specifications from the Liberal and NDP Finance critics.",

A good example of this is in the church's position on ABC.\n\nI strongly suspect the reason that the VAST majority of the laity has, almost from the beginning, rejected this church position, is that it is not consistent with their learned wisdom, and it preempts their own processes of discernment, prayer, and judicious application of the underlying principles.  The results of this position alone, have badly hurt the church, for many left outright, and many more who say have had to find a way to just ignore the church on the matter, and yet remain.  \n\nI think the church would do a LOT better to allow a bit more trust of the laity in this matter, and reflecting a bit more respect for the lived wisdom of the laity.",

For him to single out political progressives/liberals and suggest that they leave the Church is clerical/episcopal malpractice.  \n\nAn orthodox Catholic is one who roots his or her life in Christ and seeks to follow him.  There always has to be an understanding that one will never get this right, and will always be in need of reconciliation.   That is why Pope Francis consistently preaches about the importance of accompanying those who have lost their way.  That is the mercy of Christ in action.  In this instance, I sadly do not see Christ in Archbishop Chaput, but a shill for American conservatism.  That's not orthodoxy.  However, I don't think he should leave the Church.",

Does it mean that an Englishman's discovery of penicillin or the discovery of the cause and modern treatment of the Black Plague by a scientist in Viet Nam should not be applied to Native Hawaiians who are suffering from terrible diseases? Or is this an essentialized view of life in which there is no common humanity? Is this any different than some true believers in faiths such as Christian Science who allow their sick children to suffer without \"Haole science\" medical attention? One can respect the views presented by people who oppose TMT, but not the racialization of such important issues. Let us discuss these matters with civility in Civil Beat.",

Theological College (TC) at CUA is a Sulpician seminary.  Just last year and due to the overreach of San Francisco Archbishop Sal Cordileone, the Sulpicians were discharged from St. Patrick's Seminary & University at Menlo Park, CA after leading the seminary for 118 years.  They officially left at the end of the May 2017 academic year.   Cordileone ran them out.  See the related NCR article: https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/sulpicians-withdraw-san-francisco-seminary\n\nI am certain that McBrearity, TC, and the Sulpicians did not want the same thing to happen at CUA.  They caved.\n\nIn the age of Francis, this is so tragic.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  I don't see how the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. and Europe is not on a collision course.\n\nGerry, where the Sulpician prophetic voice?",

Dave now wonders if the 1.5% growth forecast for 2016Q4 isn’t much too pessimistic. Could be, but I’m not sure why he would think so.

Again, this is a power issue - beneath the 'change' lies resentment and simmering anger that they, the almighty Roman Catholic Church, were forced to recognise their deep hypocrisies and psychological problems. What worries me is that once the 'parental' (secular/media/critics) eyes are off them, who will they be? Yes, the church has changed but not enough, and the 'not enough' is completely related to the fact that the change was not a conversion of heart, but a unwilling submission to outside legislative and financial 'power'. There's 'chameleon' change and then there's deep psychological metanoia. One more point - not until the RCC openly acknowledges clergy sexual misconduct against adults as well (see https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=50509#.WWfSOelLeUk ), will any 'change' be meaningful.",

Isn't that a fair question?\n\nYes, all campaigns will make errors and there are many ways to point blame when one loses. However, I think the meddling of a foreign govt. is a different and much more insidious issue. This is an issue that threaten our democracy. The mishaps of a candidate or their campaign are not. We must come together to confront what threatens our election process. \n\nPan, being fair is difficult and, I believe, not fully possible, but we have to try. If not it won't be any hostile foreign govt. that will destroy our country, it we be our very selves.

What's key is the trait created by the modification.  Is it disease resistance, as in the papaya, or is it protection against pests?

There is no consumer benefit with this technology. To compare privacy and cyber security  threats to meter readers walking into one's yard as they have for many decades, is a specious argument.

So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.\nWhile we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.  An alternative is one in which the Eucharist encourages us to repent of our sins and reform our lives.  Instead of insisting that the Eucharist be supplied to us, we should move towards personal holiness and thus be bring ourselves closer to the sacrament.",

What a charming lad. I hope he enjoys his stay in Salem.\"\nOne of those 13 \"like\" votes was yours. No evidence, no testimony, no discovery. Just based on a rehash of an EPD press release, you approved of a future for Mr. Bryson that included a visit to the state pen.\nAnd now, after exculpatory evidence provided to the DA at no cost to her office leads her to dismiss the case, you still posit that Mr. Bryson is lying. And that neighbors and friends might be covering for him. And that the DA bought it.\nTell us more about obvious slants.",

And a more robust population in CA,  a preponderance using the margins of south SF Bay salt evaporation ponds which were scheduled for abandonment.  No hearings,  no public meeting,  just a bureaucratic process in Sacramento.  I petitioned,  as allowed in the law,  to have a hearing at Hatfield Marine Science Center.  From that came the input about Oregon's beach being public, the threats from beach grass and predators,  plus innocent  human depredation with dogs off the leash on breeding beaches.  Recreationists had to be a part of the solution,  with no immunity to being part of the problem.  Now that there are six times the number of birds,  the plover recovery has been a rewarding process for Oregonians.  The beaches are still public and only seasonally restricted for plovers,  on short sections.",

The EC conducts 51 POPULAR vote elections for president. The candidate who wins the majority of those POPULAR elections wins the White House. This time, because the cities control the unConstitutional popular national vote, there is a disparity between the Constitutional election's outcome and that of the media fantasy of a unitary election.

RELIGIOUS PATRIARCHY is even worse, because it divides the entire body of Christ down the middle.  The 1917 Code of Canon Law still prescribed that men and women should be separately seated in church, a canon that I never saw enforced and was mercifully deleted in the 1983 code.  In other religious institutions, it is still mandatory for men and women to pray separately.  But we still have canon 1024... God have mercy!",
