(You can also make this the day before and keep in the fridge.),To prepare the garlic shrimp: After peeling, deveining, and rinsing the shrimp, dry them really well on a clean towel. Mix evenly with the rest of the ingredients, cover with plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour.,To prepare the paprika mayonnaise: Mix all of the ingredients together until even, then set aside.,To make the burger: Divide the chorizo-mixture into 4 equal portions, then shape it into patties. It is very important to make sure the diameter of the patties is slightly larger than the diameter of the buns, as the patties will shrink during cooking. The next step is a little unconventional, but I like to dust a thin layer of flour on both sides of the patties so that they pan-fry into nice crusts (you can take this as optional).,Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until it's really hot, then add a small nub of unsalted butter and the chorizo patties (maximum 2 patties at a time). Leave the patties to pan-fry without moving, until a nicely browned crust has formed on the bottom. Turn the patties over, then add the shredded Manchego cheese on top (2 to 3 tablespoons per burger). Cover the skillet completely with a lid and keep cooking on medium-high heat for another 1 to 2 minutes (the steam will melt the cheese and cook the patties), just until the center of the patties is cooked through. Transfer the patties with whatever crispy cheese-bits on the side, onto a plate and let them rest.,Keep the chorizo drippings in the skillet and cook the shrimp on high heat, about 1 minute on each side until just cooked through. Then set aside.,If you want to toast the buns, remove any food particles from the skillet, leaving a bit of oil, then use the same skillet to toast the cut sides of the buns until golden brown.,Apply a good layer of paprika mayonnaise to both sides of the buns, then put 2 thinly-sliced tomatoes and a chorizo patty on top. Slice the shrimp lengthwise and place over them the patty. Close it off with the top bun. I warn you, it's going to be very messy and drippy... and happy.",

You can store the rest in the freezer in an air-tight container or snack on it as you're working.),To make the sandwich base, preheat the oven to 350 F and grease two 8x8 inch pans.

Transfer the mixture into the prepared pans and spread it evenly. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the sandwich base is set and the edges are pulling away from the sides a bit. Remove the cookies from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.,To assemble, soften the ice cream slightly so that you can spread it, but don't let it get runny. Place one of the sandwich bases (top side down) on a piece of plastic wrap and spread 2/3 of the ice cream evenly on it. You can save the rest of the ice cream in the freezer for another time. Put the other sandwich base on top of the ice cream (top side up) and wrap the whole thing with plastic wrap. Freeze for at least 2 hours to let it solidify. Remove from the freezer and cut it in half. Then, cut each section into 6 sandwiches for a total of 12 sandwiches.

Otherwise it would be listed as an optional ingredient. Go ahead and include it if you like it and don't plan to store the giardiniera for too long).,To make the brine, combine distilled vinegar with all other ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and stir until everything is well combined.,Turn on your stove vent fan.,Although this stuff really smells great, it will definitely clear your sinuses when the vinegar starts to boil.,Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 30 minutes for flavors to infuse.,Taste, and adjust seasonings as desired.,Remove from heat, and allow to cool for 20-30 minutes, but still quite hot.,Strain through a coarse sieve, and rinse solids in sieve thoroughly to remove most of the celery seed and other fine grained stuff, keeping most of the mustard and dill seeds and the peppercorns.,Be sure to incorporate some of these spices with the veggies when building the jar (s).,While doing all this, you should have been sterilizing your canning jar (s).,The easiest way is to run the jars and lids through the dishwasher on longest, hottest cycle, including the full drying cycle, and then put them on a towel in a 225 degree F oven so they can dry, and the heat can kill any bugs that didn't die in the dishwasher.,We use 2 rubber-gasket one-gallon jars, but you can use smaller canning jars if desired.,This will be kept in the fridge without being processed in a boilingwater bath, and it will still keep for months.,Rinse, dry, and stem your chives, basil, dill, and oregano, if you haven't already done so.,Break out the thawed artichoke hearts, and cut them into bite-size piece.,Arrange all the other veggies on the kitchen counter if you are going to try to make the jars look pretty; otherwise, just throw everything in a giant bowl, and toss to combine.,Pack all the veggies into the jar(s) fairly tightly, arranging them as desired; don't forget to insert the herbs as you go.,If you end up with a few extra veggies that won't fit in the jars, throw them in a lidded plastic bowl that is just large enough to hold them; this shouldn't happen, though; ingredient amounts are pretty precise.,Divide the brine equally between the jars of veggies; it's probably best to use a measuring cup, one cup here, one cup there, saving a little for the leftovers if desired.,Top up the jars to the brim with distilled white vinegar.,Use a chopstick, skewer, or skinny spoon to remove air bubbles from the jars, and tap the jars on the counter to help remove bubbles, repeating a couple times.,Add more vinegar if necessary. Wipe off the top of the jars, and seal them.,After 12 hours, gently shake or roll jars, turn them upside down, and allow to set for another 12 hours at room temperature.,Place jars in refrigerator for 1-2-3-4 weeks to age and mellow, though they taste pretty good after just 1-2 days; it's up to you!,They should keep in the fridge for at least 6 months... probably longer... but the colors will get uglier, and the veggies will get mushier.,They will still taste great, though.",

Add flour to bowl; using dough hook, mix on low speed on standing mixer until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and knead about 3 minutes more; when pressed with finger, dough should feel tacky and moist but should not stick to finger. (If dough is sticky, add another 1 to 3 tablespoons flour.) Continue to knead on medium-low until cohesive, elastic dough has formed (it should clear sides of bowl but stick to bottom), 4 to 5 minutes longer.,3. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface. Knead dough by hand 1 to 2 minutes to ensure that it is well kneaded. Dough should be very soft and moist but not overly sticky. (If dough sticks excessively to hands and work surface, knead in flour a tablespoon at a time until dough is workable.) Lightly spray medium bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer dough to bowl; lightly coat surface of dough with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm, draft-free location until doubled in volume, 2 to 3 hours.,4. TO SHAPE THE ROLLS: Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; set aside. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Pat dough into rough 12 by 10-inch rectangle (see illustration 1, below), gently pressing out air; starting from edge farthest from you, roll dough into cylinder (illustration 2). Using palms, roll dough back and forth until cylinder is about 18 inches long and of even thickness. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut cylinder in half crosswise, then cut each half into 8 evenly sized pieces (illustration 3).,5. Working with one piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered with plastic wrap or kitchen towel, form dough pieces into smooth, taut rounds (illustration 4). Set piece of dough on unfloured area of work surface. Loosely cup hand around dough (not directly over it); without applying pressure to dough, move hand in small circular motions. (Tackiness of dough against work surface and circular motion should work dough into smooth, even ball.) Arrange shaped rolls in prepared cake pans (one in center and seven spaced evenly around edges) (illustration 5); cover cake pans with plastic wrap lightly coated with cooking spray, then cover pans securely with foil. Refrigerate at least 24 or up to 48 hours.,6. TO BAKE THE ROLLS: Remove foil (but not plastic wrap) from cake pans; let rolls rise in draft-free cool room-temperature location until doubled in volume (rolls should press against each other), 6 to 7 hours. When rolls are nearly doubled in volume, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove plastic wrap. Brush rolls with 2 tablespoons melted butter; bake until deep golden brown, 14 to 18 minutes. Cool rolls in pans on wire rack about 3 minutes, then invert onto rack; re-invert rolls and cool 10 to 15 minutes longer. Break rolls apart and serve warm.",

Place the pork over the the sweet potato and now everything is ready for steaming. Into a large stock pot, add about 1 1/2 inches of water. Then place a metal vegetable steamer in the center, and your bowl on top. Cover with the lid and bring to a boil. Once the water has come to a boil, turn the flame down to a medium low. Steam for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the pork and potatoes are super tender. The water in the pot should last the whole cooking time. If it looks to be drying, you may have the flame on too high. Half way in, mix the pork layer a bit to allow the rice meal to cook evenly.,Serve immediately, topped with fresh cilantro.

If these are unavailable, just make sure you're getting as much weight of beets as you are cabbage or your soup will be cabbagey!,Once peeled, you have a bit of a choice to make. The beets need to be chopped. To get the best flavor, I think the way to do it is to cut them in half, then make half moon slices about a quarter of an inch thick. For the best appearance and bite, however, you should do rough julienne. Really, it depends on how beety you require your soup to be - sometimes a mix is a good idea.,Carefully shred your red cabbage, fairly finely. Rough chunks of cabbage ruin the texture of the soup, in my opinion.,Cut the (large) onion into half moon eighths.,Finely dice your garlic with a sharp knife to keep it nice and strong.,Bring beef stock to boil in a large stock pot, and add cabbage, onion, garlic and bay leaves. Make sure all is covered by a few inches, but not overly covered. If your stock sucks, obviously your soup will also. Maybe supplement a store-bought stock with some beef bones you've roasted in the oven to add flavor. Wait about 15 minutes before adding the beets.,Add your beets, and boil at a sort of \"fast simmer\" for half an hour. Basically you want the soup to reduce a little, but if you boil it to fast it's not sugary enough at all. Taste it periodically . . . it should get sweeter over time.,Take the borscht off the heat, cover tightly and let it cool overnight, at least 8 hours. Move it to the fridge once it's room temperature (unless you're trying to kill someone).,Season the borscht with salt, pepper and red wine vinegar just prior to serving.

Pour this in to the well, little by little, stirring and gradually bringing more flour in to the centre with a fork. Do this until all the flour is mixed in to the dough.,Next you want to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes so that it is of a smooth elastic consistency and does not stick. If you don't know how to knead dough check out www.youtube.com there are some great video's. Do this on a lightly floured surface with floured hands, applying a dusting of flour when needed. Hint: Use latex gloves to prevent dough from sticking to your hands.,Put the dough back in a lightly oiled bowl with a damp cloth to cover it. Let this sit in a warm place ideally about 40C or 100F until it has doubled in size this should take about an hour to an hour and a half. Remove the dough from the bowl and 'knock it back' punch the air out of it, do this for 1-2 minutes. Set this aside for later.,The secret of great dough is using ice cold ingredients (milk, and water). If you have time, let the dough sit in the refrigerator overnight when you reach this stage, you will need to knock it back once more before you roll it out. This will make approximately 2 largish pizzas.,For the tomato sauce i find using fresh tomatoes gives a better taste, plum tomatoes give a nice sweet taste or you can use canned ones here. Take the plum tomatoes and pierce the skin with a fork then blanch in boiling water for a few seconds, you should be able to remove the skin now. Put these in a saucepan and mash them up. Add all the other ingredients, apart from the basil, you can garnish with that on the finished pizza. Gently warm the ingredients for 5-10 minutes, don't burn it. There should be enough here for 2 fairly large pizza's.,Roll out the dough with a rolling pin on a well floured surface, apply the tomato sauce and then add your cheese. The amount of cheese in the recipe is per pizza, and should be enough for 1 fairly large pizza.,Grate the Mozzarella and apply evenly over pizza, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and the grated provolone. The secret here is not to smother the pizza in cheese you want to be able to taste the full flavours in the pizza. A selection of Italian cheeses really makes a difference too.,Add your favourite topping, My favourite topping is some portobello mushrooms sauteed in garlic butter and bell peppers, but you can add whatever you want. Again try not to smother it with toppings, the Italians tend to take the less is sometimes more approach here.,Cook in a preheated oven on your maximum setting, probably about 250\u00b0C Watch it doesn't burn it will only need about 10 minutes. A great tip is use a pizza stone, if you cook a lot of pizza and don't have one then buy one. It transfers the heat very fast in to the dough and creates a great crispy base that is unmatched to any other methods of cooking it, apart from using an authentic pizza oven.",

Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk, adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions. Mix only until the dry ingredients are incorporated and you've got a thick, smooth, silky batter.,Using a small cookie scoop with a capacity of 2 teaspoons or a teaspoon measure (in which case you'll want to scoop out rounded spoonfuls), fill each of the whoopie molds with batter -- don't bother smoothing it because it will spread under heat-or place dollops of batter on the baking sheet, making sure to leave about 2 inches of space between the mounds of batter. You'll have to work in batches, so cover the leftover batter and set aside.,Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cakes puff and spring back when poked lightly; a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Transfer the whoopie pie pan to a rack and wait for 5 to 10 minutes, then gently lift the cakes out of the molds. Or, if you baked the cakes on parchment, slide the paper off the baking sheet onto a rack and let the cakes cool to room temperature before gingerly lifting them off the paper.,Continue to bake whoopie pies -- always making sure the pan or baking sheet is cool -- until you've used all the batter. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before filling them.,To make the filling: Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a medium bowl with a hand mixer, beat all the ingredients together on medium-high speed until soft, fluffy and smooth, about 3 minutes.,To fill the whoopie pies: Using a piping bag with a plain or star tip or a spoon, put about 1 tablespoon filling on the flat side of half the cakes. Top with the other halves, flat side down, twisting the tops gently just to make certain that the pieces are \"glued\" together.,To glaze the whoopie pies: This is an optional step, but it makes the pies look like a true French pastry. Put the chopped chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl and heat it for about 90 seconds at 50% power. Bring the cream to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 30 seconds, then gently stir the mixture, starting at the center of the bowl and working your way out in ever-widening concentric circles, until you have a smooth, glossy ganache.,Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. One by one, dip the tops of the whoopie pies into the ganache, twirling each pie slightly as you lift it out of the chocolate, so that the excess drips back into the bowl, and place glazed side up on the baking sheet. When all your pies are dipped, refrigerate for about 30 minutes, or just long enough to set the glaze.,Serving: Since I've never seen a soul, young or old, drink a glass of milk in France, it's unlikely les francais would enjoy les whoopies with milk. A shame, since the dark devil's food cake is so good with milk. I leave it to you, milk or not, and if not, I'd suggest a shot of espresso.,Storing: Best the day they're made, the whoopee pies -- without the filling and glaze -- can be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months. Defrost in the wrapper.",

Add wood as needed during the roasting process.,Rinse the bird and pat dry. Make sure you rinse the birds cavity and pat dry as well. Take some olive oil and coat the cavity. Salt and pepper the cavity and add the 4 garlic halves. Squeeze half of the lemon on the inside of the bird and place the squeezed half into the cavity. Seal the cavity with the other half of the lemon.,Place the bird into a roasting pan. Cover the whole bird with a generous amount of olive oil. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the skin of the bird. Season the bird with the garlic powder, onion powder and Herbs De Provence. Take the potato quarters and place around the bird. Season the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper. The potatoes will also be seasoned by the fat and drippings from the bird.,Place the bird into the wood oven for about 5-8 minutes to brown the skin. Make sure you watch the bird to ensure the skin does not burn.,Once you have a nice brown color on the skin take the bird out of the oven and cover the whole pan and bird with aluminum foil.,Place the bird back on the deck of the oven with the pan slightly protruding into the oven. The temperature in this area should be about 350-375 degrees. The side facing the interior of the oven will be hotter then the side facing out. It is important to rotate the bird about every 8-10 minutes to make sure it cooks evenly.,A 4 to 5 pound chicken should take about 40- 60 minutes to cook. The timing depends on your ability to keep the heat in the oven fairly constant, size of the bird and the bird type. After 60 minutes, check the internal temperature of the bird for desired doneness.,The following internal temperatures are recommended for different game birds in degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nChicken - 165 degrees\r\nDuck - 165 degrees\r\nGoose - 165 - degrees\r\nGrouse - 150 - degrees\r\n\r\nPheasant - 160 degrees\r\nWild Turkey - 180,The potatoes should be done when the bird is finished cooking.

The mixture may be stiff. Add the half-and-half and the milk. Whisk well to combine. Cook over medium low heat, whisking or stirring constantly until thickened and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.,Add the butter, one piece at a time, stirring until melted before adding the next piece. Stir in the vanilla. Pour pudding into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pushing the plastic wrap evenly against the top of the pudding. This will keep the pudding from developing a \"skin\" as it cools. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until pudding has chilled thoroughly.,Toast the coconut on a sheet pan in a 325 F oven until golden. Watch carefully, browning happens quickly. When done, set aside to cool.,In a medium sized bowl whip the cream together with the 1 tablespoon sugar until it reaches preferred consistency. I like my whipped cream with a little body, not too soft, but definitely not to the butter stage.,To Assemble:,For 8 individual servings: In 8 small, individual serving dishes, layer the following: coarsely crumbled Vanilla Wafers, sliced bananas, pudding, crumbled Vanilla Wafers, sliced bananas, pudding. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of toasted coconut. Cover and allow to rest in refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours or up to overnight.,For a single dish: Do not crumble the Vanilla Wafers. Leave them whole. Place a layer of whole Vanilla Wafers on the bottom of a 9 x 9-inch dish. Add a layer of 1/2 of the sliced bananas. Cover with half of the pudding. Repeat layers: Vanilla Wafers, bananas, pudding. Top with whipped cream and sprinkle with toasted coconut. Cover and allow to rest in refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours or up to overnight.,Notes:,For smooth pudding: Blending the ingredients together prior to starting the cooking process will help insure a smoother end product. Stirring constantly is important. Don't leave the pudding unattended or else it will burn and/or be lumpy. The cooking process won't take more than about 10-15 minutes. The time actually goes quite quickly. My pudding only took 11 well spent minutes.,About cooling the pudding: As pudding cools it forms a \"skin\" on top. This skin cannot be mixed back into the pudding with good results. The pudding will be lumpy and will have rubbery particles from the skin. To avoid a skin forming, place the plastic wrap right against the warm pudding and up the inside of the bowl. Allow to cool completely in the refrigerator.,Recipe adapted from recipes by Paula Deen and Alton Brown.",

Spray an 8-inch cake pan (with at least 2-inch sides) with nonstick cooking spray with flour.,,To make the cake: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking powder, espresso powder, baking soda and salt. Add the eggs, canola oil and vanilla and whisk to combine. The mixture will be very thick - just make it as uniform as you can. Add the water, a little at a time, whisking in between each addition. Continue until you've added all of the water - the batter should be smooth and fairly thin.,,Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for 35-37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when gently pressed with your fingertip. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 15 minutes, then turn the cake out onto the rack to cool completely.,,To make the filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the peanut butter, sugar and vanilla together until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the cream, beating until the filling is smooth - it will be somewhat thick, but still spreadable. You can add additional cream to adjust the consistency, if necessary.,,To make the glaze: Combine the chocolate and cream in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds on 50% power. Gently stir, then continue heating in 20-second intervals on 50% power, stirring in between each, until the chocolate is completely melted and the glaze is smooth. Set aside for 30-45 minutes, or until the mixture thickens enough to be spreadable.,,To assemble: Use a long, thin knife to cut the cake in half horizontally to make two layers. Place the bottom, cut side up, on a serving plate. Spread with the peanut butter filling, then lay the second half of the cake on top, cut side down. Spread the glaze over the top and sides of the cake. Garnish with chopped peanut butter cups.",

Add the 2 cups of powdered sugar and stir on low speed until it begins to incorporate. Once it does, turn the speed up to high and beat until smooth. Add additional powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until desired taste and texture has been reached. Since you won't be piping this, you don't really have to worry about the thickness too much. I like my frosting less sweet so I usually don't add a lot of additional powdered sugar, but it's more personal preference on this one.,For the chocolate:,Use a double boiler to melt the chocolate coating. Set aside.,To assemble:,Place about a cup of the frosting in the bowl with the cake crumbs. Take off any rings you have (skipped that step more than once and paid for it!), then use your hands to blend the frosting and crumbs together. Once the mixture starts to clump together, try rolling it into a ball. If it sticks, you're good. If it falls apart, add a little more frosting, about 1/3 cup at a time, until the mixture stays together.,Roll the crumb mixture into 1-inch balls and place them on a baking sheet. Use a spoon to place dollops of the melted chocolate on top of the balls. No need to be perfect here, just get a nice spoonful of chocolate on each one.

Carefully smear the compound butter underneath the skin all over the meat, being careful not to break the skin. Reserve about a tablespoon of the butter, and then spread that evenly over the skin, followed by a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper.,Lay the chicken in a shallow roasting pan just large enough to accommodate it and put in the refrigerator for an hour or two (this will help the skin crisp more when you cook it).,When you're ready to make dinner, heat the oven to 425 degrees and remove the chicken from the fridge. Roast for 20 minutes, then baste and decrease heat to 375. Cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, basting once again in the middle, until cooked. Let the chicken sit for a few minutes before carving; serve with the pan juices and some crusty bread or roasted potatoes for sopping them up.",

            "input": "In a large bowl, add the bread flour and make a well in the center. Add 1 cup water in roughly 1/8 cup increments, mixing it in with chopsticks, until all the water has been added. It will look rough.,Once all of the water has been added, use your hands to mix it in, kneading it to form a rough dough inside the bowl. The dough should be dry, but if it's falling apart, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until there are no residual clumps of dough in the bowl or on your hands. Once it resembles a rough dough, turn it onto a dry surface and knead for 5 to 6 minutes. Its surface should start to become smooth.,Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes, to allow the flour to hydrate.,Remove dough from plastic wrap and knead it on dry surface for another 5 to 6 minutes. Wrap it in plastic and allow it to rest for another 15 minutes. After each rest, the dough should become visibly smoother and easier to work with.,Remove dough from plastic wrap and knead for another 5 to 6 minutes. Form a long oval shape and fold it into thirds, with the two ends overlapping, so that there are three layers. Knead it into a long oval shape again, and repeat this process another two times. Form it into a long oval shape once more and wrap it in plastic. Allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. At this point, the dough's surface should be very smooth, or \"guan hua ti shi\" in Chinese.,After 30 minutes, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and begin to cut the dough into noodles, using one of two methods: For the traditional method, use a very sharp knife and have a pot of boiling water ready. With your left hand, hold the oval dough pointed downward at a 30\u00b0 angle, with the downward-facing edge resting on a cutting board. This will help you make smooth, even cuts. With your right hand, shave the knife down the dough to create thin noodles. There's a Chinese saying to help you visualize this technique, \"Knife doesn't leave the dough, and dough doesn't leave the knife.\" It should be a continuous loop. This technique is tricky, which is why I opted to do the second, less traditional but easier technique: Place the oval dough flat on the cutting board. Use a sharp knife to slice off noodle pieces, as if it were a vegetable. This makes it easier to control the thickness and length. If the cut noodles begin sticking together, flour them with bread flour.,Add the noodles into the boiling water and stir to prevent clumping. If you're using the noodles for the stir-fry below, remove the noodles as soon as the water returns to a boil. Rinse with cold water and set aside. If you are using these noodles for soup, cook them completely through, about 8 minutes. Either way, they should be used immediately to ensure freshness.,Heat up a wok with some cooking oil.,Add in the carrots, white parts of cabbage, and shiitake mushroom, and cook until softened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.,Add garlic, ginger, and Thai chile peppers to the wok, and stir-fry until lightly brown and fragrant.,Add in the pork and cook, breaking up the pieces, until browned on all sides and halfway cooked. Add the carrot/shiitake mixture back into pan.,Add in the knife-cut noodles, sugar, and sauces (light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and Shaoxing wine). Add the white pepper.,Add in the scallions, green parts of cabbage, and egg. Stir until noodles are completely covered in sauce and the egg is scrambled in and cooked through. Add salt and white pepper to taste, and mix until well combined.,Drizzle in some sesame oil and serve hot. Garnish with scallions.",

You will only need 1 1/2 teaspoons of the spice mix for recipe; store the remaining spice mix in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 6 months.,2. To make the date filling, grind the dates and oil in a stand mixer fitted with a food grinding attachment (fine grind) or in a heavy-duty food processor. If using a stand mixer, alternate between adding the dates and oil. If you're using a food processor, before you add any dates, rub oil on the blade and inside of the bowl. Once processed, oil your hands and knead the cake spice mix into the dates.,3. To make the dough, combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a full, rolling boil (occasionally giving the pan a swirl); boil 1 minute and then turn off the heat. Cool 5 to 10 minutes.,4. Combine the oil and clarified butter in a separate small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the butter is just melted, about 2 minutes; cool slightly.,5. Put the flour in a large bowl and whisk in the yeast. Use a wooden spoon to gradually incorporate the oil mixture, then gradually incorporate the sugar syrup. Knead the dough until it comes together nicely into a shaggy dough, adding up to 4 tablespoons more flour as needed (when done, the dough will be soft and should look smooth, shiny, and slightly oily). Cover the dough, put it in the freezer to stiffen slightly, about 5 to 10 minutes, and then knead it again for a couple minutes.,6. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C); line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners.,7. To shape the cookies with a ma'amoul mold (see note below), measure 1 slightly scant tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it with your hands, then press it into the bottom and up the sides of the mold. Measure 1 teaspoon of the date mixture and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it and gently press it into the dough in the mold. Measure 1 slightly scant teaspoon of dough, roll it into a ball, slightly flatten it, then put it on top of the date mixture in the mold; use your fingers to press the dough on the top into the dough on the sides. To remove the cookie from the mold, hold the mold by the handle and tap the flat rim on a secure surface; the cookie will drop right out.,8. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets about 1/2 to 1 inch (1 1/4 to 2 1/2 cm) apart (if you use 2 half-sheet pans, the cookies should all fit on 2 pans; if you use smaller pans you will need to cook them in 2 batches). Bake until light golden brown on the bottom, about 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the trays once.,9. Cool completely, and then dust with the powdered sugar. To store the cookies, package them layered between parchment paper in an airtight container.,Notes:,Ma'amoul mold: In this recipe I give directions for how to shape these cookies with a ma'amoul mold, which can be purchased at Middle Eastern grocery stores or online. However, these cookies can also be shaped by hand. To do so, measure 1 slightly scant tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it with your hands, then hold it in the palm of 1 hand. Measure 1 teaspoon of the date mixture and roll it into a ball; slightly flatten it and gently press it into the dough in your hand. Measure 1 slightly scant teaspoon of dough, roll it into a ball, slightly flatten it, then put it on top of the date mixture; use your fingers to press the dough on the top into the dough on the sides. Use your hands to gently shape it into a circle, and then use a fork to make a decorative cross-hatch pattern on the top.,Mahlab: This spice is the seed kernel that comes from the center of St. Lucie Cherry pits; it has a lovely aroma and tastes like a cross between almonds and cherries. You can usually find mahlab at specialty spice stores or Middle Eastern grocery stores. If you can't find it, although the flavor won't be quite the same, for a similar flavor you could add a couple drops of pure almond extract.,Extra date filling: If you have extra date filling, wrap it well and freeze for up to 6 months. When you're ready to use it, let it thaw in the fridge overnight, then knead a little bit of canola oil into it until smooth.,Clarified butter (ghee): I don't recommend replacing the ghee in this recipe with regular butter because of the different water content. Clarified butter can commonly be found at regular grocery stores or easily made at home.,Recipe reprinted with permission from An Edible Mosaic: Middle Eastern Fare with Extraordinary Flair by Faith Gorsky; Tuttle Publishing (2012).",

Starting from the egg near the handle of the pan, remove each egg one by one with a slotted spoon, and drop it into the large bowl of cold water. Set the bowl aside.,2. Prepare the butternut squash: Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the cubed butternut squash and the sea salt. Toss the pan to coat the squash, then cook for a few minutes, until the squash starts to get some color on the bottom. Give the pieces another toss to brown on all sides, and continue tossing every few minutes to get more color and to cook all of the pieces. If the pan dries out (you will know because the squash pieces will start to stick to the pan), add a bit more oil. When the squash is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and set aside.,3. Prepare the miso soup: Bring the dashi stock to a simmer over medium heat. Add the spinach leaves and cook for about 20 seconds (just long enough for the leaves to wilt). Reduce the heat to low.

Tightly wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.,In the meantime, make your lemon curd. Grate your ginger and place it into a fine mesh sieve. Squeeze the ginger juice out of the ginger pulp and reserve. Combine the ginger juice, lemon juice, sugar, egg yolks, whole eggs, and salt in a metal bowl and whisk to combine.,Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Add the butter chunks and cook, whisking constantly, until the butter is melted. Continue to cook over moderate heat until the mixture thickens to a loose pudding-like consistency (like a creme anglaise). You don't want it to be entirely firm because you're going to cook it more in the oven, but you do want it to be cooked enough that it thickly coats the back of the stirring spoon.,Remove the curd from the heat. Press it through a fine mesh strainer into another bowl, cover, and place in the refrigerator to set.,Continue with making the dough. Take your dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out into a rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Fold the right third into the center, then the left third over this, just as you did before, but now roll the dough out to 3/4-inch thick again using a rolling pin. Turn a quarter turn and repeat, then turn and repeat one last time. Wrap the dough back up in the plastic wrap and refrigerate another hour (yes, this is a labor of love).,Heat your oven to 375\u00b0 F. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Cut it into 12 equal-sized rectangles (full disclosure, my rectangles are never even remotely the same size, but I try!). Spread half of each rectangle with lemon-ginger curd, fold it over, and use a fork to press around the edges to close them and make a pattern. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and place the pastries on them.,Beat the egg for egg wash and brush it over the pastries. Bake the pastries one baking sheet at a time until puffed and golden, around 20 to 25 minutes. While the pastries are in the oven, make the icing by beating together the cream cheese, lemon juice, milk, and confectioners' sugar until you have a thick but drizzle-able glaze.,When the pastries come out of the oven, transfer them to a cooling rack set over a baking sheet, then drizzle or smear them with the icing while still warm.

Set the gelatin and strawberry juice aside for about 5 minutes allowing the gelatin to bloom.

When all of the flour has been added and combined, add vanilla and incorporate well. Set frosting aside. Do not refrigerate.,To assemble:,Using a sharp paring knife remove a fairly large cone shaped piece of cake from the top of each cupcake.

Scrape finished paste into clean half or quarter pint jars. Top each jar with a layer of olive oil and place in either the refrigerator or the freezer.

(Since water boils at different temperatures in different locations, it is important to follow\nthis step.) Set some candy molds into a jelly-roll pan. Set aside. (If using metal or wood molds, lightly grease them.),Empty the large pot and place the syrup in it. Add a few drops of oil. (Boiling maple syrup will foam up; the oil keeps the foam down. Buttering the rim of the pot will also help.),Boil carefully over high heat, without stirring, until the temperature of the boiling syrup is 28\u00b0F/17\u00b0C above the boiling point of your water (212\u00b0F/100\u00b0C at sea level).,Remove from the heat and let cool for 3 to 5 minutes. Do not stir or disturb the candy at this point; if the thermometer is attached to the pan, leave it there during the cooling period.,Stir evenly until the liquid loses its gloss, starts to become opaque, and begins to thicken. (This is the tricky part; if you stir too long the thickened syrup will \"set up,\" or harden, in the pan. If this happens, add a cup of water, and reheat slowly to dissolve the sugar, then start over. But if you don't stir long enough, the sugar may not \"set up\" in the molds at all.),Carefully pour the candy into the molds. It's helpful to have an assistant spread the syrup in the molds while you continue to pour the mixture into the other molds.,Allow the candies to cool, remove from the molds, place on a rack to dry for a few hours, and enjoy.",

Bake one tray at a time in the center rack until bottoms are lightly browned but the tops are still pale, 14-16 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 5 minutes.,While the cookies are still warm, use a small, sharp paring knife to cut a circle about the size of a quarter on the bottom (flat) side of each cookie, taking care not to crack the edges or pierce the top.

Set cookies aside.,Assembly:,Stir peach juice and 10 drops food coloring in a small, stain resistant bowl until color is uniform and bright red. Transfer sugar to a small bowl.

Fill each cookie shell with a heaping teaspoon of pastry cream, smooth the surface of the cream and wipe any excess off the rim of the cookie. The cookie cavity should be full but not stuffed or the cookie might crack or break. Repeat with remaining cookies and cream.,Gently sandwich two cookies together being careful not to crack or break but pressing them together until they stick (the cream is the glue).

Turn the oven off 3 minutes after reaching the temperature.,Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray.,Place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.,Place the bowl in the turned-off oven.,Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.,After the dough rises, remove the bowl from the oven.,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.,Punch the dough and transfer to a work space.,Separate the dough into 13 pieces, about 3 ounces each, using a bench knife.,Use both your hands to roll the dough into tight, uniform balls.,Make sure there are no air pockets in the middle of your dough balls.,Roll each ball into 7-inch cylinders using both hands and rolling from the middle out.,Make sure the cylinders are even in length or your buns will be wonky.,Keep whatever dough you are not immediately working with covered loosely with plastic.,Line a 15-inch-long, or longer, sheet pan with parchment paper or cover well in nonstick spray.,Place each dough cylinder side-by-side up the center of the sheet pan, leaving 1/2-inch space between each one.,Cover the pan with plastic and allow to rise until the cylinders are touching, about 15 minutes.,Remove the plastic wrap.,Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough.,Allow the dough to rise, about 15 minutes.,Bake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, about 20 minutes total.,Allow the buns to rest in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes.,Transfer the buns in one piece (that's very important) to a cooling rack to prevent soggy-bottom buns and cool, about 30 minutes.,Transfer the buns to a cutting surface.,Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part).,You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately.,The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun.,They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose.,Now you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast.,Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use.,Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day.,Yield: 12 buns and 2 slices.,Combine the Garlic Mayo, pickles, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire, lemon juice and sprinkle with salt.,Mix until a homogenous consistency is reached.,Combine the lemon juice, mustard, salt, garlic and egg yolks in a blender or food processor.,Blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth.,Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified.,You will hear a \"slapping\" sound from the blender or food processor when the oil starts to emulsify.,Blend the mixture until all of the oil is incorporated; the consistency should be that of a heavy mayonnaise.,Use the mayo immediately or refrigerate and keep for up to a month.,This recipe can also be made by combining 1 cup store-bought mayo, 1 clove crushed garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.,Combine the Garlic Mayo, Creole mustard, light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, scallion, buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, black pepper and jalapenos in a medium mixing bowl.,Whisk the ingredients until incorporated.,Set aside.,Any of this mixture that you do not used can be stored in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks.,Toss the coleslaw, jalapenos and Garlic Mayo mixture to desired creaminess in a large mixing bowl, about 6 tablespoons Garlic Mayo mixture to 4 cups coleslaw.,Serve immediately.,Yield: 4 cups.",

            "input": "Pie pumpkins \"are smaller, sweeter, less grainy textured pumpkins than the usual jack-o-lantern types. Grocery stores usually carry them in late September through December in the U.S. Note: the Libby's can of cooked pumpkin is just there for reference - it is the small can, so that gives you an idea of the size of a typical pie pumpkin. They're only about 6 to 8 inches in diameter (about 20 to 24 inches in circumference). If you're in a pinch and can't find a pie pumpkin, here's a tip: butternut squash taste almost the same! Commercial canned pumpkin is from a variety of butternut, not true pumpkins! If you DO use a regular Jack O' Lantern type pumpkin, you may need to add about 25% more sugar and run the cooked pumpkin through a blender or food processor to help smooth it out.,Just like selecting any squash, look for one that is firm, no bruises or soft spots, and a good orange color. One 6\" pie pumpkin usually makes one 10 inch deep dish pie and a bit extra; or 2 9 inch shallow pies!,Wash the exterior of the pumpkin in cool or warm water, no soap.,Cut the pumpkin in half. A serrated knife and a sawing motion works best - a smooth knife is more likely to slip and hurt you! A visitor suggests using a hand saw.,And scrape the insides. You want to get out that stringy, dangly stuff that coats the inside surface. I find a heavy ice cream scoop works great for this.,Note: SAVE THE SEEDS:,The seeds can be used either to plant pumpkins next year, or roasted to eat this year! Place them in a bowl of water and rub them between your hands. then pick out the orange buts (throw that away) and drain off the water. Spread them out on a clean towel or paper towel to dry and they're ready to save for next year's planting or roast.,There are several ways to cook the pumpkin; just choose use your preferred method. Most people have microwaves and a stove, so I'll describe both of those methods here. But others make good arguments in favor of using a pressure cooker or baking in the oven. At the end of this document, I've included alternative instructions to replace step 4, if you'd rather use a different method.,Method 1 - Put it in a microwaveable bowl.,Remove the stem, and put the pumpkin into a microwaveable. You may need to cut the pumpkin further to make it fit. The fewer the number of pieces, the easier it will to scoop out the cooked pumpkin afterwards.,Put a couple of inches of water in the bowl, cover it, and put in the microwave.,Method 2 - Steam on the stovetop.,You can also cook it on the stovetop; it takes about the same length of time in a steamer (20 to 30 minutes). I use a double pot steamer, but you could use an ordinary large pot with a steamer basket inside.,Either way, cook for 15 minutes on high, check to see if it is soft, then repeat in smaller increments of time until it is soft enough to scoop the innards out. Normally it takes 20 or 30 minutes in total.,Whether you cook the pumpkin on the stove, microwave, or even the oven, once it is cooked until it is soft, it is easy to scoop out the guts with a broad, smooth spoon, (such as a tablespoon). Use the spoon to gently lift and scoop the cooked pumpkin out of the skin. It should separate easily an in fairly large chucks, if the pumpkin is cooked enough.,Many times the skin or rind will simply lift off with your fingers. I'll bet you didn't realize making your own pumpkin glop -- err, \"puree\" was this easy!,Note: there are many varieties of pumpkin and some make better pies that other (due to sugar content, flavor, texture and water content. Drier, sweeter, fine-grained pies; the small (8\" across) ones called \"pie pumpkins\" are best.,Watery pumpkin?.,If your pumpkin puree has standing, free water, you may want to let it sit for 30 minutes and then pour off any free water. That will help prevent you pie from being too watery! Beyond, that, I have not found that the water makes a difference - I wouldn't be TOO concerned about it!,Tip from a visitor: \"I make my own pumpkin pies from scratch all the time. To eliminate watery pumpkin I strain my pureed pumpkin through a cloth overnight. If I use frozen pumpkin I do the same again as it thaws out. It works great and my pies cook beautifully.\".,Another visitor reported success using coffee filters in a sieve to drain out excess water.,Again, don't go to great lengths to remove water; the recipe accounts for the fact that fresh pumpkin is more watery than canned!,To get a nice, smooth consistency, I use a Pillsbury hand blender. By blending it, you give the pie a smooth, satiny texture; rather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes.,A regular blender works, too (unless you made a few frozen daiquiris and drank them first.). Or a food processor or even just a hand mixer with time and patience.,With the hand blender, it just takes 2 or 3 minutes!,Another visitor says using a food mill, like a Foley Food Mill, with a fine screen, accomplishes the blending/pureeing very well, too!,The pumpkin is now cooked and ready for the pie recipe. Get the frozen daiquiris out from step 7 and take a break! :) You may freeze the pie filling.,Yes, I know there are ready-made pie crusts in the frozen section at the store, but they really are bland and doughy. A flaky crust is easy to make! Again, note that unless you use large, deep dish pie plates, you may have enough for 2 pies.,It is also time to start preheating the oven. Turn it on and set it to 425\u00b0F (210\u00b0C, for those in Europe) (see my pie crust recipe).,All the hard work is behind you! Here's where it gets really easy. If you start with a fresh 8\" pie pumpkin, you will get about 3 cups of cooked, mashed pumpkin. The right amount of ingredients for this is as follows:,1 cup sugar - or 1 cup Splenda, or 3/4 cup honey (honey may make a heavier pie, though).,1.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon.,1 teaspoon ground cloves.,1 teaspoon ground allspice.,one half teaspoon ground ginger.,one half teaspoon salt (optional, I don't use any).,4 large eggs.,3 cups pumpkin glop (ok -- \"sieved, cooked pumpkin\").,1.5 cans (12oz each) of evaporated milk (I use the nonfat version).,Mix well using a hand blender or mixer.,Notes: The vast majority of people tell me this is the best pumpkin pie they've ever had. It's light and fluffy - however -- if you want a heavy, more dense pie, use 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 1.5).,like a deep, full pie, so I fill it right up to about one quarter to one half inch from the very top.,Don't be surprised if the mixture is very runny! It may start as a soupy liquid, but it will firm up nicely in the oven! Note: the pie crust is brown because I used whole wheat flour! Tastes the same, but is healthier.,TIP: What do you do if you end up with more filling than will fit in your pie crust(s)? Easy! Of course, you can make another, smaller pie crust and fill a small pie pan -- or just grease any baking dish, of a size that the extra filling will fill to a depth of about 2 inches (see the photo at right), and pour the extra filling inches then bake it. It will be a crustless pumpkin pie that kids especially love!,Bake at 425\u00b0F (210\u00b0C ) for the first 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake another 45 to 60 minutes, until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean.,And enjoy! Warm or chilled, with whipped cream , ice cream or nothing at all - it's great!,I use a blunt table knife to test the pie. The one at left has already been stuck in the pie, and you see it comes out pretty clean, when the pie is done.",

Watch the pot carefully, as the cream will scorch and bubble over if allowed to boil. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove pan from heat. Let sit at least 5 minutes to infuse cream with the vanilla.,Meanwhile, whisk sugar, cornstarch and egg yolks together in a large bowl. Slowly pour the cream mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly. If baking custards right away, remove vanilla bean; otherwise, cover and refrigerate with bean in custard up to two days.,Preheat oven to 325 degrees with the rack in the middle position. Set 8 6-ounce ramekins in a large casserole pan (you can use smaller or larger dishes; the cooking time will vary only slightly).,Divide the custard mixture into ramekins (about 3/4 cup in each). Fill the casserole pan with very hot tap water 1/2 of the way up the ramekins and carefully transfer to the oven. Bake just until set, about 25-30 minutes (time will vary depending on your oven), turning the pan once if the custards seem to be setting unevenly. The custards shouldn't bubble during cooking. If they do, remove immediately.,When done, the custards should be set on the edges and jiggle very slightly in the middle when shaken. You don't want them to be too firm. Remove from oven and allow to cool in water 10 minutes before carefully removing from casserole dish.,If serving right away, keep custards at room temperature. If not cooking right away, refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours, then cover. If chilled, remove from refrigerator and allow the custards to come up to room temperature, about 45 minutes.,Using a blowtorch: When ready to serve, sprinkle turbinado sugar, about 1-2 teaspoons each, and place dishes on a nonflammable surface. If you do not have turbinado sugar you can use granulated but just use a very thin layer or it may brown too much in some spots.,Following manufacturer's directions, light blowtorch and bring to medium heat. Using a circular motion and being sure to get the edges, caramelize the sugar directly and completely with flame. The crust should turn a deep golden brown color. Garnish with fresh fruit and/or cookies if desired.,Using the broiler: Refrigerate the custards up to a day. Dry the brown sugar (you can do a large batch and save it) on a cookie sheet in a 200-degree oven for 20 or 30 minutes. Let cool and run through a sieve or sifter. It will hold indefinitely.,Preheat boiler. Sprinkle a thin layer of brown sugar, about 2 teaspoons, on each chilled custard, using a finger to gently spread it evenly across the top. Position a rack 3 or 4 inches from broiler. Place sugared brulees one or two at a time under heat, carefully moving dishes slightly to caramelize sugar evenly (a broiler's heat is rarely even).,This takes a little practice and a lot of concentration, so you might want to do one or two as an experiment before you try it with company. When evenly caramelized, set aside and continue with the rest. Garnish with fresh fruit and/or cookies if desired.",

Boil the potatoes on medium-high until they are tender, about 30 minutes.,Hard-boil two eggs. Here's our method: Place 2 eggs in cold water. Fill the pot just enough to cover the top of the eggs. Turn stove to hot and bring water to a boil. As soon as the water starts boiling, remove the pot from the heat and place a lid on it (I just move the pot over to a cold burner). Let the eggs sit in the water for about 30 minutes. Rinse the eggs with cold water (this helps the skin peel off easily).,While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop a medium size white onion. Then chop up the whole jar of sweet pickles. SAVE THE PICKLE JUICE!,Once the potatoes are tender, drain and mash up the potatoes with a fork or spoon. Mom uses a electric mixer to make them light and fluffy.,Now the fun begins.,First, add your chopped onion and pickles to the potatoes. Then chop up your hard-boiled eggs and add them to the potatoes.,Pour the pickle juice from the jar into the potato salad. Pour a little at a time and taste as you go. Add as much or as little as you like (Mom adds all of it).,Add the Miracle Whip. Sprinkle lots of celery salt and ground pepper, but remember to taste it before adding too much. You can always add more.,My Mom doesn't add salt at this point, but she's not a salt person. You may want to add some, but personally, I don't think it needs it. If you do, but all means, add it!,Boy oh boy, this is good salad. This makes a big ol' batch too. You can feed around 10-18 plus people with this recipe.,You can always modify the amount you make by using less potatoes and reducing everything else.

Then I used a 1 inch heart cutter to cut the center out of half the cookies to make these cute sandwich shapes perfect for Valentine's Day. If you decide to do this just be sure you have the same number of whole round cookies (for the bottom) as ones with heart-shaped cut outs in the middle (for the top).,Then place your cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet and pop them in the oven for 14 minutes, rotating them halfway through the cooking time.,While you are waiting for your cookies to bake let's start the simple filling. In a small sauce pot add your jam, orange zest and salt and let this come to a slow boil, using a whisk to bring everything together. Once the jam is at a boil remove it from the heat and set it aside to cool.,When your cookies are done baking place them on a cooling rack. Once they are nice and cool it's time to assemble your sandwich cookies. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the jam on the flat side of the round cookie then top with heart cut out cookie.

Heat it over medium heat and stir it to dissolve the espresso powder into the liqueur for just a minute. Don't let it come to a boil. Set it aside. Then get out a stand mixer and combine the cream cheese and sugar in its bowl. Beat them together thoroughly, until fluffy. Add in the eggs one at a time. Then pour in the liqueur mixture and heavy cream, pushing down the sides occasionally. Let the stand mixer beat the mixture really thoroughly until it is completely smooth.,Pour the cheesecake mixture on top of the cooled crust and smooth it out on top. Then wrap the springform pan in aluminum foil snuggly and place it in a large roasting pan. Pour warm water into the roasting pan around the springform pan about 1/3 of the way up the sides, taking care to not get any on the cheesecake. The foil protects the pan from water getting into the cake too. This creates a steam bath to gently bake the cake without it cracking on top. Bake the cheesecake for an hour and a half.

            "input": "Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the mixer bowl. Using the paddle attachment, mix briefly to distribute the ingredients. Cut each stick of butter into 8 pieces and add them to the bowl. Mix on low speed until most of the mixture resembles very coarse bread crumbs with a few larger pieces of butter the size of hazelnuts. Cut the cream cheese into 1-inch cubes and add them to the bowl. Mix on medium-low speed until the mixture is damp and shaggy looking and holds together when pressed with your fingers, 30 to 60 seconds. Dump the dough onto the work surface, scraping the bowl. Knead two or three times to incorporate any loose pieces. There should be large streaks of cream cheese.,Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to mix. Cut the butter into 3/4-inch cubes and add to the flour mixture. Pulse until the butter pieces range in size from coarse bread crumbs to hazelnuts. Cut the cream cheese into 1-inch cubes and add to the mixture. Pulse until the dough looks damp and shaggy and holds together when pressed with your fingers. Dump the dough onto the work surface, scraping the bowl. Knead two or three times to incorporate any loose pieces. There should be large streaks of cream cheese.,Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a 4-by-5-inch rectangular patty about 1 inch thick. Wrap and chill the dough until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.,Remove the dough from the refrigerator. If necessary, let the dough sit at room temperature until pliable enough to roll, but not too soft.,Mix the sugar with the cardamom. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the mixture to a small cup and mix thoroughly with the salt. Set aside. Divide the remaining cardamom sugar equally between 2 bowls; you will use one bowl for each piece of dough you roll out.,Sprinkle the work surface liberally with some of the cardamom sugar from one of the bowls. Set 1 piece of dough on the sugared surface and sprinkle it with more cardamom sugar. Turn the dough frequently and resugar it and the work surface liberally as you roll the dough into a 24-by-8-inch rectangle that' s less than 1/8 inch thick. Use the cardamom sugar generously to prevent sticking and to ensure that the cookies will caramelize properly in the oven. Trim the edges of the rectangle evenly.,Mark the center of the dough with a small indentation. Starting at one short edge, fold about 2 1/2 inches of dough almost one-third of the distance to the center mark. Without stretching or pulling, loosely fold the dough over two more times, leaving a scant 1/4-inch space at the center mark. Likewise, fold the other end of the dough toward the center 3 times, leaving a tiny space at the center. The dough should now resemble a tall, narrow open book. Fold one side of the dough over the other side, as if closing the book. You should have an 8-layer strip of dough about 2 1/2 inches wide and 8 inches long.,Sprinkle the remaining cardamom sugar under and on top of the dough. Roll gently from one end of the dough to the other to compress the layers and lengthen the strip to about 9 inches. Wrap the dough loosely in wax paper (not plastic wrap, which might cause moisture to form on the outside of the dough and will dissolve the sugar). Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Meanwhile, repeat with the second piece of dough and the second bowl of cardamom sugar.,Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.,Remove 1 piece of dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and use a sharp knife to trim the ends evenly. Cut 1/3-inch slices (I mark the dough at 1-inch intervals and cut 3 slices from each inch) and arrange them 1 1/2 inches apart on the ungreased or lined cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the undersides are deep golden brown. Rotate the pans from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking.,Remove the pans from the oven. Turn the cookies over. Sprinkle each one with a pinch or two of the salted cardamom sugar, reserving half of the sugar for the second round of baking. Return the sheets to the oven and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the cookies are deep golden brown. Rotate the pans and watch the cookies carefully at this stage to prevent burning. If the cookies brown at different rates, remove the dark ones and let the lighter ones continue to bake. For lined pans, set the pans or just the liners on racks to cool; for unlined pans, use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to racks. Making sure the cookie sheets are completely cool, repeat with the second piece of dough. Cool the cookies completely before storing. May be kept in an airtight container for up to 4 days.",

Before you fill the crepes, peel the skin away from each piece of squash.,While the squash roast, make the crepe batter (see below).,To make the crepe batter, combine all ingredients from the whole milk to the eggs in a blender and process until smooth.,When you're ready to cook, heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat (you can use an official crepe pan, but you don't need to). Drop 1/2 teaspoon of unsalted butter in the hot pan and wipe it around with a spatula. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the middle of the hot skillet, swirling to distribute the batter quickly and evenly. After about 1 minute, run a spatula around the edge and bottom of the crepe, then flip it over. If you're topping the crepe with cheese, sprinkle the cheese on top at this point and cook for another 30 seconds, then slide it out onto a plate.,Repeat, cooking the crepes with the remaining batter or until you have as many crepes as you like, stirring the batter every so often as you go.,I recommend eating the crepes as you go since they are best right from the pan and take only a minute to cook. As one family member fills their hot crepe, another one is done cooking. Fill the warm crepes with the roasted squash, black beans, avocado slices, and a dash of hot sauce (if you like).

Makes 5 cups.,BISCUITS: Preheat oven to 450\u00b0.,In a large, chilled mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using two knives in a scissor-like fashion (or a pastry cutter), cut in the fats into the dry ingredients. Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk.

You don't want to give them a chance to rise, until they hit the oven. Gently reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible and continue cutting.,Bake until biscuits are tall and light gold on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Brush tops with melted butter. Makes about 9 two to three-inch biscuits.,EGGS: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the cream and whisk until the eggs look foamy and light. Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Melt the butter until it foams, and then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the eggs.,Using a heat resistant rubber spatula, slowly stir the eggs from the outside of the pan to the center.

A light rub of coconut oil is a good idea if your worried about the non-stickiness of your pan.,Pour a scant 1/4 cup (just under 1/4 cup, or 3 1/2 tablespoons) batter into the preheated pan and swirl around until pan is evenly coated. Cook until outsides of the crepe darken and the inside feels just set, about 4-6 minutes depending on your pan. Mine were perfect about 4 1/2 minutes.,Very gently pick up the crepe and gently flip over. Cook until the other side is just set, only another 20-40 seconds; you don't want to dry them out! Repeat until all the batter is used, storing the crepes in the fridge on a plate as you cook them. You want them nice and cold when you put the cream on! You should end up with 17 crepes.,For the cream:,Place coconut cream, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla extract into a large bowl. Using an electric hand mixer, beat until smooth and well combined, scraping the sides down as necessary. Set aside 1/4 cup of the cream for later use.,To assemble:,Place one cool crepe down on a plate, or cake stand, and top with 1 heaping tablespoon coconut cream. Using an offset spatula (this will make your life so much easier!) spread it thinly over the entire surface of the crepe. It won't totally cover the crepe, and it does not need to look pretty! You won't see the layers.,Lay 2 tablespoons thinly sliced strawberries flat on top of the crepe, spreading them out evenly. Repeat the same process until all the crepes are used.,On the last layer, you should have some strawberries left over, as well as the reserved 1/4 cup of coconut cream. Carefully spread the remaining cream evenly over the center of the top crepe, spreading almost to the edges. Assemble all the remaining strawberries in a pile in the center of the cake.,Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set the coconut cream. Slice and devour!,Notes:,1. I use the Thai Kitchen pre-canned coconut cream. Each can has about 1 cup of coconut cream in it,after draining the liquid out, so you'll need two cans, and use the remaining on something delicious! You can also buy two cans of full fat coconut milk and leave them in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning, flip them upside down, open them and drain out the liquid. You'll be left with coconut cream!,2. They should actually be called \"large lemons.\" Don't try the buy the normal-sized lemons that just look the largest, or your cake won't have a nice lemon flavor!,3. These crepes can be sticky, so make sure you use a really good quality nonstick pan. I originally made this recipe with a really old pan that has all its nonstick goodness scraped off, and it did not work. I used it an excuse to get new pans and, voila! Perfect crepes!,4. It really helps to preheat your pan for a good 5 minutes before starting to make the crepes, since the temperature is so low.",

You can add more, to taste, if you want.)\r\n\tJuice the remaining limes over the vegetable mixture, stir to blend well, and refrigerate.,When ready to serve:\r\n\tStrain seafood from the lime juice. \r\n\tAdd seafood to the chopped vegetable mix and stir to distribute evenly. Divide salad evenly between 4 bowls. \r\n\tServe cold with an icy cold beer or crisp white wine. On the porch. With some reggae in the background. Life is good.,Final Note: You can add dill or shredded basil if you wish, even fennel fronds; I didn't have any fresh herbs when I made this yesterday and the fresh flavors and snap of the vegetables were sufficient enough that I didn't miss the herb note.",
