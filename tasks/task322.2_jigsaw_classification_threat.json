Simply changing the players is not the total solution if they don't follow their own procedural rules and instead continue to favor a standing caucus based on \"traditions\" instead of those written rules. \n This standing caucus system has created a \"legislature within the legislature\".  Anyone from any party can join as long as they \"behave\".  \n Voters must ask these candidates if they will join a standing caucus that demands \"lock step\" voting for a final budget regardless of sustainability and to follow leadership on all procedural votes used to quash suggestions from non-caucus members.  Also will the candidate support the current legislative exemption from state open meeting law?  \nFinally, great photo of the clown.   I particularly enjoy the irony that the clown in the photo is not smiling which means the photo could actually be a legislator on the way to the capital.",

For climate change to be wrong, the entirety of physics must be wrong - right down to the most basic laws of thermodynamics.\n\nAs far as claims go, there is hardly a more extraordinary one you can make than 'fossil fuels are not warming the planet' - and it requires therefore, equally extraordinary evidence to even be considered likely.",

You have to sterilize almost all the cats in a large area (not just a local \"colony\") to reduce population growth. That goal has never been achieved. \n\nTNR proponents like to cite a few instances where a \"colony\" declined or temporarily disappeared, but these \"successes\" all seem to refer to the last of the original cats dying of old age (or killed by a car or whatever), and don't account for new cats entering the population through reproduction, immigration from nearby areas, or illegal release.",

I'm well aware of Trump's past statements, but pandering to the most reactionary and retrograde elements on the right helped get him elected, and now he is all about the base. Trump appears to be descending into some kind of dementia. His politics revolve around the cult leader: himself.\n\nI've had enough of your bs. Good day.",

Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South. After 1964 and particularly after Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy got Reagan elected, Dixiecrats switched their party loyalty to Republican. Today their are very few Democrats in Southern state government.\n\nYour revisionist history is garbage, crafted to lure the ignorant toward racial hatred by making progressivism out to be evil.

President in waiting Cyril is being honest and open unlike those who meet at night in some hotels and come with lists for branches to endorse. \n\nPersonally I dont support some of the names in his slate and my branch has pronounced on the names we wish to be included in his collective. I have been a delegate to the conferences and still a delegate in this upcoming watershed conference. I have also seen some funny names that are being sold to branches to be included as NEC members with dubious and Guptarised characters.",

We're proposing that the name be Pop Keeney Memorial Stadium, honoring both the Northshore students who went through the school system, as well as Pop Keeney himself.  \n\nA gorgeous monument could be constructed just outside the gates with two granite plaques, one for Pop Keeney, and one for our fallen classmates.",

Another colleague of mine left shortly before I did and totally reaped the benefits.  \n\nSo my advice to others in my boat:  don't say no!

They sent helicopters to spray weedkiller on marijuana fields, and threw users in jail. The result was an epidemic of crystal meth -- \"ice\" -- which is far worse.\n\nToday Big Brother is trying to intimidate doctors from prescribing opioid pain killers. If that effort succeeds the result will be a huge rise in addiction to heroin, because people can get heroin on the street very cheaply compared with the hassle and expense of a prescription for opioids.

When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health. It is important to be sensitive to different identities that do not necessarily fit into binary male or female sex categories.\"\n\n\"Socially constructed characteristics of women and men....\"   Get it? \"Socially constructed.\" There is a perfectly good word that refers to the biological characteristic of sex.

He will have a chance to redeem himself if this bill ever makes it to a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nBut I hope it never makes it that far. Lisa and Ohio Dan should vote against the motion to proceed, and not even let it come up for a vote. KILL it!",

And that should include price changes such as PV module costs that have seen a decline of around 30% since the first Q of 2016 and the fact that a rise in see level of say 10 feet (Greenland alone to contribute 20 feet) is likely to impose costs on human society in the hundreds of trillions of dollars (flooded cities and port facilities, reduced trade, much greater refugee flows, etc. leading to much higher likelihood of war). Those too are facts revealed by science- the same science that allowed the development of the advanced technologies we live with today. Yes- oil and gas have provided hundreds of trillions of benefits but now the costs are mounting and we have to develop alternatives that wont destroy us.",

There is no such thing as a loophole in those regulations, they are what they are! And if they're wrong - the state has been incorrect and misleading builders across the board, but they're not. Just because you own a home near one of these doesn't give you the right to demand they go away! If you were so concerned why did you buy in an are with no HOA/restrictions.

The priest used to tell jokes even during the consecration of the wine.   At weddings (I used to be an altar boy at them) he had a \"wine joke\" he'd always tell over the microphone to the groom, as he gave the groom communion from the chalice.....  I also was extremely disillusioned by the very wild \"liturgies\" conducted in my high school's gym.   (They also had a chapel in the high school, and I literally was the only student out of hundreds who would stop in there to pray.).  \n\nThere happened to be an SSPX church in my area.  I stopped in there at age 21 to see what a Tridentine Mass looked like.  I was blown away by the reverence shown by people.",

What?  Did they EXPLODE when the cops shot 'em?  Melt?  Vaporize like vampires in sunlight?

The Mitchells, perhaps being young and inexperienced with the realities of the death of a child, relied on their faith to save the one child but relented and used the medical options available to save the other child after receiving sound medical advice.

It is one thing to say, “I had an interesting dream last night.” However, it is quite another matter to say, “God gave me a dream last night, and you must obey it.”\n\nHowever, I meant to ask how you understood Revelation 12:17 and 19:10, in which it states: \"For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.\"?",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

God calls men and women to priesthood which is why they are both physically and spiritually capable of performing all the tasks of a priest, bishop, cardinal or Pope.  \n\nGod calls both men and women to parenthood which is why there is no imbalance in this vocation either.  Women are not more important parents than Fathers.  \n\nJust because men are capable of being fathers, and Jesus was never a father, does not result in fertile men can't become priests.  Having one capability does not negate having other capabilities.  \n\nWhenever we keep people from what God has called them to become based on how they are born, and are capable of performing, we harm them greatly.  We imprison them though they did no crime.  We diminish their humanity.  This results in the person feeling hated and betrayed by their own people, and it weakens their faith, in Christ, who has promised justice to all of his followers.",

Even if 40% of their investments were in fixed income, their 2016 returns should have been in the double digits.  I was a little over 24% up last year, although not something I think will be repeated very often. \n\nI buy many of the same equities as you.  I hold 6 of the 9 you mentioned. I do stray into some small caps, but all of them are dividend payers and most are dividend growers.  My current portfolio yield is 5.1%, which beats their expected returns on yield alone. \n\nIt would have been interesting to see what asset mix returned 4.9% last year (the FA's benchmark in the article) just to give us a better idea of their risk tolerance.",

This is how humans get it in their dinner-meats, cats roaming around stockyards and farms (herbivores can contract this parasite in no other way). 60%+ of game-animals too. This is why cats are routinely destroyed around gestating livestock or important wildlife by shooting or drowning them. So those animals won’t suffer from the same things that can happen to the fetus of any pregnant woman. (Miscarriages, still-births, hydrocephaly, and microcephaly.) It can make you blind or even kill you at any time during your life once you’ve been infected.

I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

So it is a draw.  Market has been crazy hot, but it is cooling down a little - just as a real estate agent.   So things should calm down a bit, especially as all the new apartments finish construction and flood the market with space.  \nIf people are moving here after seeing Portlandia, they aren't techbros.   Nor do they have money to price you out of your rent.\nI'd be curious to see where exactly all these techbros and infiltrating Californians are moving.  Knowing all the high tech jobs are concentrated in Downtown...wait no...I mean NE...no....SE...no...SW...kinda but really out West in other cities.

The fuel for a non-stop flight is even less due to the aircraft remaining at altitude, flying a more direct routing, and not having to make other stops.  The airfares are out of wack to Seattle given the distance compared to destinations in California.  I would also like to see Southwest even start considering some day international flights out of Hawaii to the Far East, as Hawaiian and other airlines are also majorly gouging for the distance involved when you compare it to  mainland routes distances (not to say those are reasonable by any standard too).

The tone for this is set outside of either of these institutions. There does not seem to be any trust from the bottom to the top and vice versa. A strong leader is needed to help us get out of that funk that has been stagnating the processes for a long time now. Anyone caught telling everyone else to sign it then read it needs to be removed from office post haste.

There is a place and a time for each. Sketching can get the required information out fast to the Contractor and we sometimes simply scan in the sketch to the computer drawing set afterward rather than redraft it in CAD.  Clients love a sketch.  CAD is great for repetitive details and coordination.  They supplement each other.  Cursive, in my opinion, is much the same as a sketch. Fast, easy, and individual. \n\nHuman society has been based on handwriting and hand-written documentation for centuries and to simply dismiss it as no longer required is short sighted.  When children learn cursive, it is part of their development in learning hand-eye coordination and it a good early indicator of dyslexia and other visual issues. Cursive is gone from Alberta schools and I think we will be poorer for that decision.",

I wasn't on any one QB's bandwagon, but I think Siemian's a better fit for the offensive players, since Lynch seemed stuck in that first-read-then-start-running game.  Maybe with some protection this year, Siemian gets more confidence and the game slows down for him.  Not going to put the cart before the horse, but last game Siemian looked like it was coming together for him.  The ball was in an area clear of defenders, before the receiver was obvious, and the ball met him at the right spot, largely in stride.  He was throwing them all over the field, too.  Really anxious to see what's up with the run game.  Got my fingers crossed Charles is still special.  That guy's exceptional.",

Instead of helping immigrants to assimilate into American society, it encourages them to continue speaking their native languages, to wear their native attire and most unfortunately, to live in communities with their own kind.

A black person cannot simply identify as a white person, just like a man cannot simply identify as a woman and expect a reasonable person of faith to accept it as normal.  As Christians, we follow THE TRUTH, which cannot be debated.  The truth is marriage was created and implemented by God as the union between male and female. Genesis 2:24-25.  Same sex marriage is a falsehood unlawfully imposed on America.",

He throws left handed. The proper place to catch the ball for him would have been shoulder high near his left shoulder so the transition to his throwing hand would have been a few inches. Cargo caught it on his right side and had to move the ball a couple of feet to get it to his throwing hand. Little league stuff--sheesh. 3. You either throw the ball completely in the air to the catcher OR one long hop to make it easy for the catcher to catch and apply the tag. Cargo mid-hopped  and handcuffed Hanigan.

First of all, get rid of all of the stupid, underutilized bookstores, etc. in the concourses.  You could cut them in half, at least and still have plenty.  Those spaces could be used for bars and restaurants.  Second, DIA's master plan has a allowance for at least two more concourses.  You could build one of them much cheaper than this project.

The Stirling Highway has a daily traffic count of over 5,392 cars, according to ADOT.  The proposed road in Izembek, maybe a handful per year.  At a time when Alaska has $2.5 billion dollar budget deficits, we can not afford to spend money recklessly.  If a developer builds a subdivision he places the cost of the roads he builds into the price of each lot he sells.  So it is not unreasonable to ask locals to contribute.

The plot involved an actual Communist who was persuaded to set the fire. The Communists were kicked out of the Reichstag, giving the Nazis the votes to pass the Enabling Act, which gave Hitler dictatorial powers. \nToday, some hotheads ( of various stripes) are all too willing to be the stooges of the alt-right by committing ridiculous and ineffective acts of violence that will provide the extreme right elements in the Trump administration with excuses to impose extraordinary measures.

One was for 3 ten second TV spots running in regional US markets.

He goes cheap at QB, cheap on tackles, cheap on coaches, and this is the result.  I doubt we win more than two games the rest of the way, where we will end up taking another QB in the first round that Elway will whiff on. I hope we get new ownership and they kick Elway to the curb and let him go be a contributor on Fox News or whatever position he can be in the right-wing spotlight that he desires. Ego maniac qb's don't make good GMs, they still think its all about them and they can do it all themselves! You didn't win until you had a stud o-line and RB Elway!

They can bleat all they like, but in consistently failing to demonstrate their god's existence, they are the ones revealing that their chosen god does not exist.

Renewables provided less than 8%.\n\nAs for costs, the Ontario Energy Board reports that in its regulated price plan for 2014 to 2015 that each unit of hydro generation cost 5.,1 c/kWhr. Nuclear cost 5.9 c/kWhr.  Wind was more than double these rates at 12.3 c/kWhr. As for solar--out of sight at 47.6c/kWhr.\n\nSo Mr Dogterom is right on one thing: the numbers don't lie. What the numbers tell us however is that nuclear and hydro generation provide Ontario consumers with low-cost, carbon-free electricity.  And the renewables industry on the margins is less about harvesting nature's bounty than it is about harvesting the subsidized rates handed out by the ON government.",

It helps to be associated with a \"good\" candidate and hurts to be associated with a \"bad\" one.  GOP candidates are realizing just how \"bad\" a candidate Trump is and, fearing the damage from being associated with him, are distancing themselves.....and wisely so.  There's a real chance that Trump's candidacy may lose the GOP both the House and the Senate.  It's very difficult to lose the Presidency in a \"landslide\" w/o negatively impacting those down-ballot races..and, at the rate he's going, Trump is headed for a landslide loss.",

More recently, however, there's been a shift as Canada has seen a growth in immigrants (and their offspring) from other religions, often from regions and/or communities where religion is synonymous with personal identity. One study, for instance, indicated that over 60 percent of Muslims in Canada identify primarily as Muslims rather than as Canadians. For many Canadians this is a troubling trend. As my now-deceased father used to note, the most positive social development he witnessed in his lifetime was the decline in sectarian religious chauvinism in the aftermath of WWII.

Once the recession took hold, the construction boom collapsed with an effect that rippled through the rest of the economy. The Canadian experience is that housing construction is robust in at least a couple major centres as a result of high immigration and an influx of foreign capital.

'Critical thinking' about politics in the US is virtually impossible if you don't know the basic 'facts'.   I would bet that no more than 10%, (if that) of current Oregon High School graduates, even know what you are referring to.  One has to know what was in the Original US Constitution to even understand that basic question.  Remember, 60% of the registered voters who actually vote in this country can't even name One (1) of their two US Senators.

It was a rushed job. The only other major mistake was when police cordoned off a large group of peaceful protesters on Queen St and did not let them out for hours while in the pouring rain. Clearly an error in judgement or communication but is was an inconvenience and protesters got an apology.\n\nTo say that G20 protesters had it bad is an injustice to real protestors (MLK / Freedom Riders, Gandhi, Mandela and others we will never know of) who risked their lives for a just cause.\n\nBTW what does Jane / Finch have to do with the article?",

From information put out a few years ago I recall the US spends between 50% and 100% more for its health care services.\n\n2. I read a report recently that suggests that in the US as many as 200,000 to 440,000 die each year from botched medical procedures. The report was a few years old but still revelant. In Canada it is estimated that about 150 people died from botched medical procedures last year. I think the reported US numbers are excessive but it points to a serious problem with quality of service.\n\nFrankly, I would prefer to wait a while for medical services in Canada rather than run the risk of dying on the operating table in the US.",

There are 100's of thousands of Scribe mistakes in old bible copies. Not a single solitary fragment of the original letters of Paul or writers of gospels have been ever found.  The earliest dated new testament biblical fragment is 150AD and it's a copy of  a tiny snippet of Thomas's work.

The recollection that we are in pure consciousness makes every action an act of worship and in this sacred space we achieve love, peace and integrity. This is the purification that cleans and shines our mind, the mirror that reflects the beauty, kindness and love that is in our soul and our mentality can help our spirit by being compassionate and nonjudgmental. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/John-J-Kuykendall/e/B018AK0WKY/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0",

According to the US Census Bureau, Hispanics can be of any race; white, black, native Indian and in between. The vast majority identify as white. It is not up to you to decide how they identify. \n\nWhen Florida was ruled by Spain, never by Mexicans, its population was mostly Native Indians. It was annexed in steps; it became completely American by 1821; pop in 1830 was 35,000.  \n\nThe American Southwest was ceded by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848; many of its Spanish/Mexican settlers wanted the territory to be annexed to a country with less turbulence than Mexico. 100,000 Mexicans lived in the areas ceded, like California, New Mexico and Texas. Residents had the choice of relocating to Mexico or receiving American citizenship with full civil rights. The two main Republican contenders against Trump were two Hispanic-Americans, Senator Marco Rubio, Florida and Senator Ted Cruz, Texas.",

Everything we are supposed to be is sitting there in our own past. It was attacked endlessly by capitalism for a century and more, but people's hearts have no confusion when they're led to the good.\n\nWe've just run this massive experiment to see what happens if we let greed and avarice rule the system and shout down the good and diverse moral voices of our country for nearly forty years. The things that have been done with this system in that time boil blood and blister faces. We never talk about this stuff, just brush it off, and that's because our debate has been astroturfed over badly and it's been going on for so long, many people who have been embedded in it lack perspective.",
