Pakistan and Iran benefit in a similar manner.  Iran is proceeding with ICBM tests (withNK) and Pakistan freely gives sanctuary to terrorists who are making sure that the Afghanistan war drags on & on.\nThe US naturally feels threatened by a despotic rogue regime which daily threatens to \"mercilessly annihilate\" the US and her allies: the RoK, Japan, and Australia.\nWhen this storm breaks it will result in a global catastrophe.",

Did Comey take notes when Loretta Lynch directed him as to how to word the announcement regarding Hillary's email investigation? Why didn't Comey \"correct\" new comer President Trump if he wasn't following protocol while talking with Comey? It sounds to me like Mr. Comey has revealed some inadequacies on his part as Director of the FBI. Should his testimony be trusted?",

Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years, according to a report released by his doctor.\nThe side effects of this drug are legion, and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.

But we're talking about the legitimacy of the laws that emanate from a given electoral system. In an ideal sense a law may not be considered fully legitimate until there is consensus on it. That's obviously not going to happen with millions of voters, so the question is, how do we move closer to true legitimacy? An honestly counted FPTP is obviously closer than a corrupt system.

While federally recognized tribes generally are not subordinate to states, they can have a government-to-government relationship with these other sovereigns, as well. \n\nFurthermore, federally recognized tribes possess both the right and the authority to regulate activities on their lands independently from state government control.  They can enact and enforce stricter or more lenient laws and regulations than those of the surrounding or neighboring state(s) wherein they are located. Yet, tribes frequently collaborate and cooperate with states through compacts or other agreements on matters of mutual concern such as environmental protection and law enforcement. \"\nhttps://www.bia.gov/frequently-asked-questions",

Low tide around Chugachik Island last year, for example, only exposed tidal flats that resemble an artillery range, as the formerly abundant clam beds have been eliminated by all the sea otters who have desperately dug them up almost to the last clam, leaving gaping holes in the process.\n\nThe wide diversity and abundance of intertidal sea life in Kachemak Bay is, for now anyway, mostly just a memory, and will remain so until something happens, or steps are taken, to reduce the extreme overpopulation of sea otters in those waters.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

And that means by clergy and laity alike.

This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.

Last year when prices tanked, processors retroactively changed prices and billed the farmers on average over $100 000 even though the farms were losing money and the processors were making profit at the time. So the question is, how do we deregulate and not follow Australia's example ? Are we the public ready to accept a lot of larger farms that will be needed to pursue the export market ?

It is estimated that California produces seven times the amount sold legally in dispensaries.  Since few growers are signing up for the legal marijuana program  there is actually a concern whether enough will sign up and submit to regulation so the legal market can be supplied.  This is a time of great glory and opportunity for the black market.  The best thing that could happen now would be Federal de-regulation and let the states decide one at a time what their policy is going to be.  Eventually all state governments will want a piece of the action and will do something to generate tax revenue.  It would be stupid not to.  Especially when west coast weed is flowing east with no taxable benefit to the states it passes through.  In Oregon, we have the most lenient of the marijuana laws.  The ability to grow your own is a huge threat to the state's legal distribution of taxed marijuana.",

This erodes savings and investment and it encourages borrowing and spending. The $20000 object which you borrowed to buy today (at 20% interest p.a over 5 years) was likely to cost you $100 000 cash in 5 years time, so it made sense to borrow now. Besides, you'd probably get double-digit pay-increases every year anyway, so the principal you'd borrowed was shrinking as a percentage of your income.\nToday OECD nations have reined in inflation so well (sitting around 1% p.a.) that they are now in danger of slipping into an even more destructive force: deflation. SA's inflation (near 7%) is still way too high to worry about deflation, so it needs to be hauled down lower.",

I am, however, also disgusted at the obstructionist games that public administrators play in order to keep their budgets, often at the expense of efficiency. I completely understand why people roll their eyes when folks in the government cry, \"the sky is falling\". The rhetoric is largely short-sighted and selfish: cut the government but invest in oil (so I can keep my job), tax the evil oil companies (so I can keep my job). The legislators just advance the narrative that is going to get them reelected (so they can keep their jobs).",

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex.

Greif and the Oregonian probably sensationalized the story, that's what the Oregonian does with everything. But it was also apparent the product on the field had been trending downward for a couple years. It wasn't like the 2011 game vs. Auburn where it was oh-so-close. It was random, oddball losses in a couple seasons that led to some big blow-outs this past season. And it did look like players were yukking it up on the sidelines some of those times. The effort didn't look the same. \n\nI think Helfrich is a smart guy and a good football guy. I was a bit stunned they fired him. But Taggart has definitely brought some energy the program needed.",

Common sense tells you to be leery of these.\n\n- The number of new accusations is very small: 25. Of these, almost half are \"unsubstantiated.\" Two have been substantiated, the rest are still being looked into. All these were reported to civil authorities.\n\n- An interesting detail if you read further on page 19: much of what the report lumps together as \"child sexual abuse\" turns out, upon closer examination, to be  \"more of a boundary issue and not sexual abuse.\" \n\nOnly for someone truly embittered is this a bad report.",

When President Obama was in office he enacted many Executive Orders that liberal people liked very much. When President Trump came in, he undid these orders which upset those same people. Some of these orders were not actually legal because they were not enacted by Congress. I get the feeling that Trump is trying to get the Congress to do what they used to do - which is make laws!

Don't you see the game being played here? There is a great effort to blame the restructuring of the PFD on the Governor when that was just one part of his plan to responsibly deal with the deficit. The legislature is incapable of coming up with any plan that would do more other than take more from the savings account that in the long run will cost the state even more.

He \"knew better\" what to do and he would do it as soon as he got into the Oval Office.\n\nBut it's been two months and all he's done is to ask the generals to give him their plan.\n\nOkay, let's unpick that, along with his reported statements during the campaign about using nuclear weapons.  I'd say the \"secret plan\" was a surprise nuclear attack on Raqqa, where the ISIS leadership is holed up.  I'd say he wanted to order that attack in his first week on the job, but the generals told him it would be a war crime that would kill hundreds of thousands of civilians, and they wouldn't do it.\n\nBut now Trump has suffered humiliation. Maybe his diminished political capital won't let him build his wall or cut taxes.  He needs a big success.  And there's Frank with the nuclear football.",

The Post is like a funhouse mirror of society, but typically reflects what people who are not like me think about life and the issues before us. Since the Post sells a lot of papers every morning, it shapes and is shaped by public opinion, even if that opinion doesn't resonate with my experience. Reading the Post helped me understand that Trump not only could win, but that many of the people who voted for him hated the Clintons in a visceral manner. \n\nTo the point: I think compromise is not possible right now, because that same kind of visceral response is raw in the open would of the election",

Comey wasn't thought to be incompetent, in fact he was a hero in the FBI for standing up to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and refusing to renew spying on US citizens. Comey knew exactly what to do, and requested additional funding to do it. Trump was screaming at his TV over the Trump-Russia hearings and demanded that Comey be fired, in order to stop the investigation. The FBI isn't \"sorely wounded\" and certainly not by the previous administration, which DID NOT fire Comey.\n\nYour post is pure fantasy.",

I understand why they feel the need to \"censor\" certain posts that they feel might cause them to be a party to litigation (statement like \"so and so robbed the bank, if untrue),  but for the most part, 99% of what is posted, even the personal insults, unless they use profane name calling or insane threats, can be screened better by a human. I do not enjoy or want to post on a site where the gutter mentality of some posters runs amuck but there may be a more \"humane\" way to do it. For the most part I think the \"reactions\"  can satisfy one's feelings or \"thoughts\" about the posting/comment. Perhaps there could be a few more added, such as VILE, SICK, and REMOVE. If a posting gets enough \"removes\" from individuals  it could automatically disappear into the cyber worm hole. Or, instead of negative, since so many desire approval or worship by others, they could add, SUPERIOR, MAGNIFICENT, WINNER. \nHmm, would that lead to civility?",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

At least 90 percent of health care is privately delivered in private medical clinics. Health Care Insurance in Canada has morphed into a major ambiguity. Who actually can define anything the act that federally superimposes control by using funding or the lack thereof as an effective tool to deliver timely care with the least suffering? The system is nice to those at the top and claimants are just second class compared to those that can pay cash in addition to the government insurance claims. This is insurance, period. I remember when I worked in insurance. I have worked in public health insurance at OHIP and private casualty, property  and liability insurance understand the fundamental principles of indemnity. That's the problem, too much private medicine and not enough high quality public clinics that are delivering timely care to anyone covered",

That being said, we are building the right kind of system if we want to maximize ridership and land use impacts.

The 2 cities are almost exactly the same size (pop = 600k city, 2.3 million metro), but Portland build at-grade light rail and Vancouver built grade-separated metro rail.  Both cities' first rail line was built at the same time (1985 & 1986). The impact has been very different. Daily rail ridership: Portland 116,000, Vancouver 390,000.

Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

He ruthlessly used healing as bait, to trick as many victims as possible to come forward as this was a cheap way to eliminate us all at once\nHe then spent 5 yrs, + millions fighting us, saying not even one victim's claim was valid\nThe result, the archdiocese kept 200+ mil in cash, did not sell 1 property\n\nWe learned Dolan had secretly paid the clergy that raped us, 20k to quietly leave\nIn bankruptcy most victims got much less than the men who raped us\nWe are emotionally destroyed. \nIs this Mercy?",

We treat drug abusers who are people suffering from addiction like criminals and put incentive into the hands of criminals to distribute. I'd rather have the sick people out in the open and remove the incentive of criminals. When it comes to harsher substances like heroin or meth those shouldn't become legal but we shouldn't treat it's victims as criminals, just it's perpetuators. Sweden has some interesting things its trying in this regard. \n\nBottom line is that I'm interested in seeing the problems we wish to solve solved. I don't think prohibition is the answer.

Gore (2000). \n\nA solution would be for all states to agree to assign their electoral votes proportionally to the popular vote in their own state. If this were done -- even with the small-state advantage built into the Electoral College -- Trump would still have lost (given the campaigns and votes as they were).",

I personally believe our \"gun problem\" is not the gun but a more deeply rooted problem in America. A problem of little regard for laws. See when you have things like drug prohibition, it makes people use to breaking the law in addition to creating black markets that settle their disputes with violence. Additionally there is a complete breakdown with family structure. Divorce / split homes are common, people are growing up essentially with no parenting. They are being parented by violent video games and movies with little to no definition between right and wrong. stricter gun laws, banning firearms isn't going to keep people from breaking the law, murder is against the law.",

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

And guess who pays for your legal fees?  You.  And guess who pays for the HOA legal fees?  You again (along with all your neighbors).

It was a confusing time.  Combine the uncertainty with the fact that Trump was not a decision maker and you have a situation where, in my opinion, he had not clearly formulated his opinion even to himself.  He may not have been vehemently opposed in an emotional sense.  That does not mean he supported the war in an active sense.  Recall that a good citizen, at the end of the day, supports their country and the decisions their representatives make.  The media and the Clinton campaign are the liars in my opinion.  Clinton actually voted for the war.  Her team is trying to defuse her responsibility by pulling Trump into the muck too.",

Ninety percent of abortions occur in the first trimester, which means the vast majority of women who don't want to be pregnant abort early.  It is perfectly legal so why on earth would they wait? Women who abort later than the 5th month--certainly any that wait until 8.5 months! --do so because something went terribly wrong and the child they wanted is either a direct threat to their own life or has something terribly wrong with it that has just been discovered. Nobody waits that long, endures that long of being pregnant and then aborts for fun.  \n\nTo be \"all about\" something, she'd have to be telling women what a wonderful thing it was to abort, and encouraging women to do so.

I further think, once the new \"civil system\" becomes established, it will drastically reduce honest discussion: i.e. if a large enough contingent of liberal commentators object to those expressing conservative viewpoints, what's to keep conservatives from being shut out of the discussion, simply because enough folks are offended by their politically incorrect comments?

You should own and run a business because the risk/return relationship is favourable.  You don't own a business with the expectation of the govt supporting your feasibility by allowing the owner to sprinkle income to kids.  It's not just doctors, it is also lawyers, accountants, business owners of private companies, etc..  The govt doesn't owe you a special tax break that others don't get (deferred income).  The govt shouldn't allow you expense deductions that others don't get (i.e. write off phone bills, home office, car usage, meals, computers, etc..).",

Everyone has to have skin in the game in order for everyone to be covered by health insurance or individuals who are lucky enough to have employer sponsored health insurance will continue to see increasing premiums.

If you have the idea that every question was solved immediately by some foreign person, and that any kind of discussion of our faith is a sign of \nunfaithfulness, weakness, or relativism----there is a real difficulty to that kind of understanding.  \n\n\nA different atmosphere has to be created in which people can understand what's REALLY central, and what is new.  And lets not have the same criteria imposed for the new issues as they have for the issues that have been discussed for centuries or millennia.",

What protections, for example, will exist for smaller provinces whose cottage industries could be wiped out by the equivalent of dumping? \n\nBased on the most recent pipeline controversy in western Canada, we can assume energy is on the negative list. Provinces like B.C. and Quebec will still be able to exact a heavy toll on the transmission of energy through their provinces - if they allow it at all.

The weapons charge was due to a hand gun that was still on the seat of his car after he had been target shooting, that had inadvertently had a coat pushed onto it. The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

The name calling and hysterical response and obsession to everything happening south of the border is proof of that. Anger is typically a useless emotion and revenge seems to be the outcome being advocated by many. It won't work nor will shouting, demonstrations and moralizing from Canadians. Think strategically.",

The solution is not nudging pensionable age over by several years, since keeping older workers in the labor force longer crowds out younger people.   Demands for, and pursuit of, higher education is inextricably interwoven with the social institution of retirement.  We should not overlook that.",

No GM is forfeiting games for artificial reasons, that will only serve to deteriorate the relationships with the coaches, players and the parent ball club, not to mention the other club involved.

I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”\n\n Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US\n\n(cont'd below)....",

Ask yourself what makes that being less a person than a newborn, whose life we'd never take.  \n\nAs for El Salvador:  You say they are still having a very high abortion rate despite having laws against it.  I don;t know, but I'll accept what you say.  I agree with most of your remaining points.",

All because CONgress refused to raise rates to sustain the creation of the most important department serving the nation by Ben Franklin.  After privatization, all postal rates were raised to put it in the black.  The new Republican-appointed Postmaster General, immidiately spent millions to redesign his office.  At the same time, the same traitors destroyed the national passenger rail system to transfer the mail system to airlines and trucking to bail out both industries.  The new system created a system of consolidations to serve the transportation hubs which sent mail in crazy routes to get maximum return for the new transporters.  New sorting stations were built to support the system causing mail from one local area to a nearby one to travel hundreds of miles away and back instead of reaching a few miles destination. Just one of Republican/DINO evils.",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

With over 300 million of them in private ownership and that ownership Constitutionally protected. they will not disappear.  I think it's far more sensible and realistic to seek ways to decrease their misuse.  Each year tens of thousands of Americans die from gunshot wounds......accidental, self-inflicted, and intentional.   We need to work together to significantly decrease that number.  We need to work to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them.  Additionally, we need to address the personal and emotional problems (mental illness, including depression and PTSD), substance abuse (a significant number of gun deaths involve alcohol or drug use) which contribute heavily to gun deaths.   regards, Gary",

The data from Portland is pretty clear: Beyond a certain point, limiting land supply creates higher housing costs and generates pressure for development in nearby areas.\n \nIt should be obvious from a day spent looking at a map and driving (yes driving) to Creswell, Junction City, Veneta, etc. that without very savvy planning holding the UGB ad infinatum will displace some of the population who would prefer to live in Eugene to outlying, but nearby communities.\n \n-- Paul",

Ice against steel is an awful noise. Flat on deck the rope snapping like dynamite & the hook hit the bow. Then the tug started going backwards engines roaring as they hit full throttle. My dad had unhooked cargo net as all this was going on. The cargo hook got caught on his parka hood and lifted him up before it tore loose.

That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",
