In fact the federal and state penalty guidelines are as follows :  \"Federal penalties are up to $15,000 per incident and up to one year in prison while state penalties include fines up to $10,000 for the incident and up to $5,000 per animal harmed.\" That applies to everybody.  So why are these kids getting preferential treatment? And whats the real reason for hiding the truth about what that reason is Chad?",

Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  \nOf course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.

So the conclusion, all of us, that is all of us, have the same chance given approach and response of taking rounds from police. Anchorage this week is an example. The last American-African I recall being shot and killed was a guy named \"Smitty\" by a trooper on Tudor Road behind that cowboy bar that's gone, over 35 years ago.

They expect and get help from their doctor but the doc doesn't have time to follow the patient as closely as he should due to government paperwork hurdles and over-prescribes...so it starts.  \n\nWho the #@!!% is anyone to judge the need for pain relief.  For that matter, who has the right to judge the person who suffers psychologic pain if they can't get high.  The government needs to get its invasive nose out of people's private lives and stop judging and criminalizing people by 19th century standards.",

Much of this does not support the idea that closing the entire area to Hawaii-based fishing vessels will serve the interests of conservation.

I'm pretty sure Kodiak Island has gone through some equally unjustified restrictions on projects designed to benefit Alaskans, be they commercial, subsistence, or sport users, solely based on decisions by Refuge Managers that control 60%+ of the island but admittedly don't have fishery resources in mind. Kodiak might be a unique example because it's a Kodiak Bear Refuge, but regardless of how I feel about the current commander in chief, I think the rest of the state would benefit from having a discussion about how the Refuges manage the surrounding waters.",

Heat our home inefficiently ? Recycle ? Buying the latest and greatest ? \n\nOr, are we spending more, demanding more for personal renewable energy ? It is not all about saving money, it is about saving the earth. Yes, on the ledger, China and others perform as you say. However, things in this country will do a lot better if we Americans would wake up and realize and trust in the simple concept of supply and demand.

He's been formally accused of raping an underage girl. \nTrump and the Republican party represent this trash culture well. They subscribe to a sort of Madonna/whore version of femininity where women and girls' humanity is suppressed or obliterated and most importantly, women are objects for men's pleasure and ultimate disposal. Make no mistake, the Republican party kills women.",

Mr Comey is in administration, but in a state ruled by law he has independence to investigate where the evidence leads without interference, which firing him may be, even if within the President's powers.  So, examples please?",

They said they were working on it.   This may shock you---but I'm glad everything turned out right . It does make me mad that these poor dogs are put on a short chain tied to a dog house most of their life with only brief rides packed in tiny cubes on the back of trucks while being forced to run many hours through blizzards just so their owners can win prizes.  Short races like the Rondy don't hurt dogs--but the long races are killing dogs.  Shall we allow dog fighting again ? People claim the dogs love running---no they don't !

This time, the Web site examined the entire period from 1990 to 2009. Over those twenty years, it reported, Trump had “donated a total of just $3.7 million to his foundation.” That figure confirms Trump’s claim that he has given “millions” away, but it hardly amounts to “many millions,” “millions and millions and millions,” or a hundred and two million. For the period from 1990 to 2009, his annual donations to his foundation averaged $185,000 a year.\n\n\"The Smoking Gun’s 2011 article concluded that Trump “may be the least charitable billionaire in the United States.” It also suggested that he was one of the wiliest. Years before the Post’s stellar reporting, the Smoking Gun revealed that Trump had found a clever way for his foundation to give away more money—by using cash donated by other people.\"\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-and-the-truth-his-charitable-giving",

I would invite anyone to demonstrate, for example, how \"the widest possible space is [to be] open to women in all areas of culture, economics, politics and ecclesial life itself\" without the reality of lifelong virginity or comprehensive fertility management. On the subject of same-sex relationships, a good start would be to stop silencing the theologians--something that is done almost exclusively in the Roman church.

I saw most outside unable to enter the building because they \"did not have the proper equipment\", according to the HFD spokesperson.  The question shouldn't be if we need sprinklers to make it safer for firefighters but why didn't HFD have the proper equipment to respond to a high-rise fire with so many condos under development.\n\nLet's get one thing straight: people likely died because of the inadequate fire alarm and lack of an evacuation plan, not the absence of sprinklers.  Sprinklers mitigate property damage and control the fire until the firefighters can respond.  Sprinklers are not designed to extinguish fires, unless halon is the extinguishing agent.  Sprinklers also do not prevent smoke, which is likely what killed the individuals.",

In fact, the Church makes the situation worse with every attempt that has as its fundamental agenda the protection of bishops, ministers, and popes.  I am and have been greatly disappointed in Pope Francis in his continued ineffectiveness on this point. It is best, I believe, to forget the Church doing anything on its own regarding abuse, but that it be forced to do so via every legal action available in every country touched by the Church system.  We must fight against the weariness of such efforts, and push for them in honor of all of those who have been harmed as well as our faith in what Jesus taught us about sin.",

Somebody had cancelled and I guess the station manager felt I deserved some reward for extra duties I'd taken on at the station. There was no advertising about the trip or my presence. I did not speaking or socializing I didn't want. In fact, I got to know a PR/Advertising person who later was able to help me as a source nail down a difficult story.\nI think the issue mainly becomes one of public perception -- like so many things for journalists and lawmakers.

Read about the bloated salaries of the principals many above 6 figures. Read about how her \"change\" as resulted in almost no measurable improvement in the quality of the education system in Detroit and Michigan. \n\nFinally, really dig deep and figure out who really is benefiting from Betsy's \"change\". Here is a hint, its not the kids.

The real bad guys always had guns, but we knew who they were.   Both my sons who are police officers tell me they now consider that every one could have one.  \n\nSo, if you extrapolate the fact that guns are so common place in the U.S. and the number of shootings both by and of police officers, it is no wonder that incidents like this take place.  Scary stuff.  \n\nOne other point, contrary to what the author maintains, the protest by BLM over the shooting just proves one point.

They fulfill their housing needs by renting; exacerbating the rental shortage and driving rents higher.\n\nThe current rate of mortgage arrears in Canada is 0.28% - this is fixing a problem we don't have.  But if you want to further divide the country in housing-haves, and housing-havenots, this is the way to do it.\n\nFor Toronto and Vancouver, limit foreign buyers.

The unholy alliances between multinationals and governments  (read the space in which corruption thrives) are a natural result of our capitalist system.

Recreation is not identified as an objective, much less as a priority. How recreation can be squared with protection is a major theme of the planning process for the Monument, now in its third year. Yet the Interior Department has jumped the gun, promoting tourism at Iceberg Point and elsewhere in the Monument. Parking expansion is not just about safety and access to county land. It will foster access to Iceberg Point, before we have agreed on how much tourist traffic Iceberg Point can sustain. Let's finish the Monument management plan before we build more parking for visitors.",

Well if you take ENB's share price from the day the price of oil peaked until the day it bottomed (average decline was 70%, range was 62% to 80% and average timeframe was 32 months), the return on ENB's stock was an average gain (note it was a gain, not a loss) over all of those times when the price of oil was decimated, was 66%.

Was not even part of the thinking process.\n\nNow, how do I reconcile that decision with my Catholic faith. I don't because the church is not monolithic. Any of us, whether Republican or Democrat, can twist and turn our partisan politics in any religious direction to justify our vote. I did not vote for Trump because of my faith; I did so because I am a conservative. Hilary was not.\n\nI think that it is disingenuous to assume that good Catholics wear their religion on their sleeves when they vote. They don't.

Since that funnel runs through his hotel, it boosts the brand value of his hotel and, thus, Trump. It doesn’t prevent diplomats from choosing to stay in his hotel to curry favor with him. It will still flatter him, because he flatters easily. Also, we will never know if he even donates the money, because he doesn’t provide proper accounting documentation for anything, and it’s not clear how “foreign government payments” would be separately accounted for anyway.

There is complete disunity in Europe as to future direction - more integration vs less integration, fear of even greater German domination etc.  Meanwhile the UK will fully control critical economic levers such as taxation, monetary policy, fiscal policy, regulation  and can direct all of these towards achieving success for UK exporters in foreign markets, including Europe.

I'm sorry it has felt unsafe for your family. Lack of education and purpose and hope are the problems.",

Your question affirms my point that once an observer has a category (e.g. \"male\") in mind, there are almost automatic limitations on the following observations. Two thoughts come to mind.  The first is that the physical distinctions are not always that easy to identify (hermaphrodites, for example). The second is that regardless of the physical \"category\" there are the psychological identifications (of the one being observed). Transgender people almost always describe that they knew this \"psychological truth\" early in life.\n\nAs scientific knowledge progresses very likely the categories become more \"fine-tuned\" - hopefully gradually closing in on what is \"more true\" of reality than was previously understood. The mores and laws of any social group/government always lag behind what is actually happening in a population. I would love to know what the laws of the US will be in 200 years.

Certainly true that RHO was wildly over-optimistic that he could change relations with the Middle East but that doesn't translate into making things worse. Something is broken - I say I can fix it - I can't fix it - it remains just a broken as before.",

A Vietnamese gentleman saw me looking out and said in English, \"that is a very nice view\" and I said, \"Yes it is. The last time I saw this view was 45 years ago\". He looked at me and said \"you were in the American War?\".  He, then asked to sit down with me.  Which I said sure and we had a 45 minute conversation.  You see, they have more than \"one war\" by which they define things.  We were just another domino, in-their-way, to independence.  Hola from sunny Costa Rica.",

Rumour has it by removing the education related work experience job offer  in Canada component.\n\nThey are also looking at reforming TFW permits so that PR status can be achieved.  BC is also lobbying the Feds for their own Investor Immigrant program, akin to Quebec. And of course the Feds are looking at retooling and relaunching the Federal Investor program.\n\nThese temporary programs  may soon come with easier ability to transition to permanent status, and it will be easier to enter Canada than as an immigrant.

On the other hand, with Biki, I just walk around the corner, pick up a bike, ride it to Kapilaoni Park or wherever I want to ride it to, and return it closer to my destination then do it all over again when I'm ready to go home.

Diogenes was quite a character and prone to making practical jokes in a satirical fashion to prove a point.  Naturally, there was no social media and the issues of the day were simple and dealt with piety, honesty, modesty and how best to make governance of people work for the betterment of all. Issue were not nearly as complex as the Honolulu Area Rapid Transit (HART), campaign spending, homelessness and global warming.  Then a persons conduct was based on some sort of logical approach to issues or plain old common sense. Well, that was well over two thousand years ago. Today, its more about lobbying, special interest, political party warfare, the preservation or destruction of the social contract, the cost of health care and fake news.

Together, these change the composition of the different layers in the ocean there causing less mixing between warm and cold layers and thus less melted sea and coastal land ice. \n\nAlso, while there has been an increase in sea ice, there has been a greater *decrease* in land ice.",

The error margin depends on the country and on the greenhouse gas.  I think the interest is partly in carbon dioxide emitted from energy systems, and in that case, it really depends on how much a country invests in collecting energy statistics.  For countries like those in the EU or the US or Japan, my guess is that the error margin is something in the order of plus or minus 5%.  For those discharging smaller quantities of CO2, the error bars, I think can be as high as 20 to 25% and there are some very large countries – in China, we’ve actually published the estimate that they are maybe as large as 15 or 20",

In the same election an anti-Catholic initiative was approved by Oregon voters stipulating that attendance at parochial schools did not meet the requirement for school attendance.\nBesides anti-Catholic bias there was a major bias against Jewish people (ie Klan members boycotted the Meier & Frank store as it was a \"Jewish store\").

Whatever the skills of new immigrants, recent arrivals simply aren't as successful as were their cohorts in previous generations. By some estimates, this is costing taxpayers $25 - $35 billion annually at present, and rising. Immigration used to be a nation building strategy, first to build an agrarian economy that required agricultural labour and later to sustain a growing industrial economy that required factory workers and tradesmen. But in a transitional post-industrial economy, the role of immigration is unclear. Now, it's seen more as an investment that, hopefully, will someday produce dividends on the billions being poured into supporting a lot of economically marginal migrants.

They described an incident when Trump came to pick up Donald Jr. for a baseball game and when he opened the door to his father wearing a Yankee jersey, Trump Sr. slapped him across the face knocking him onto the ground in front of his friends and told him to put on a suit and meet him outside. \nThis is the kind of man Donald Trump is--a man that beats up and humiliates his own son in front of his peers.\nThis is the kind of man that white Americans chose because mainstream white American culture at heart is a violent and soulless culture.

Horgan is going to pay self-serving unions with a record of supporting US protectionism. Horgan is the equivalent to the Notley,Wynne,Robertson clown shows - he promises unicorn and rainbows with a willful ignorance of reality. The BC Liberals are not perfect but the NDP would be the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Imagine Greggor Robertson's smug eco-zealot ignorance applied to the entire province and look out.",

If women want to work in high tech or want high paying jobs, then study, train, develop skills for, and apply for these jobs.  It's that simple.  There are no educational boundaries, no barriers to entry or advancement for women in high tech.  Complaints from society about a 'gender gap' are nonsensical.

The Dems pretty much controlled all Southern state governments from the 1870s for the better part of a century, during which in the early part of the 20th century the ranks of the KKK were in the millions.  All big cities in the U.S. have been under Democratic control for decades; how well has that gone for the non-Whites who live there, especially in the gang-controlled massive (ware)housing projects?  Just seeing how Dems attack and slander any Black Republicans tells us all we need to know about how they really feel.  Phony compassion.",

She then pulls off her black robe to reveal a sequined costume and tap shoes.\nShe's been known to hop on a tabletop or in one case on a judicial bench during these special events and do some pretty impressive steps. \"I may be the highest ranking tap dancer in federal court,\" Callahan said with a grin during a recent interview in her chambers in the Sacramento federal court building. \"It is fun and it has a certain shock value.\"\"\nhttp://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/who-is-consuelo-callahan",

An effective means to do this is to have a 12-16 hour window in which one does not eat, which can be done by skipping breakfast. Indeed, regular fasting is a part of most traditional cultures that have persisted for millennia. Of course if one eats very badly in the remaining hours of the day and has other poor habits the benefit of a daily fast may be undermined, but the conclusions imposed on the associational data by the AHA are unscientific and the AHA's dietary recommendations have done nothing to improve health and have arguably worsened the type two diabetes epidemic.",

What Obama's executive order did had little if anything to do with keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. It put 75,000 people on the NICS's \"no guns\" list simply because they indicated to the Social Security Administration that they needed some kind of assistance with their finances. This could mean that they needed someone to take their check to the bank to deposit it or it could mean that they were mentally incapacitated to the extent that they could no longer handle their finances (and if addled to that degree, should probably not possess a gun). However, there was no way to determine the degree or type of impairment. Then, as has been pointed out, the order amounted to the deprivation of a Constitutional right without due process or even notification.\nI think the order was just Obama's feel good effort to add to his legacy.",

With a few obvious exceptions, such as the hunting example you mentioned, it doesn’t really matter what role is assigned to which sex.  The important thing is that they're a binary opposition.  Think de Saussure, think Levi-Strauss.\n\nI’d argue that the perverse attempt to steamroll over human nature is the cause of much mental illness today, particularly gender dysphoria and disorders of sexual attraction.",

The only major bright spot is real estate/construction, which has exploded to become 1/3 of GDP. It's the boom in this one sector that is making everything look \"good\" economically. But if you look at this \"success\" in any sort of detail, it sure doesn't look like a win if your goal is to build a sustainable economy that will prosper in the future. The economy is very de-diversified. The Lower Mainland has a growing net loss of people under the age of 45, with 60%+ people reporting a desire to leave the region (which comprises over half the province's population). Business and government leaders in Vancouver, and now Victoria are reporting significant issues attracting and retaining talent. These sorts of problems are not the byproducts of a well run economy.

Everybody drinks water, after all, mostly from the tap. “Public health bodies need to have the courage to look at this review,” says Sheldon, “and be honest enough to say that this needs to be reconsidered.\"",
