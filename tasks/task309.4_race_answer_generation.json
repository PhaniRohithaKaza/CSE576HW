Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.\nWhat, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular.

They are asking all those wishing to celebrate Halloween this year to respect those who don't want to join in.\nSome forces, like West Mercia Police, have produced \"Sorry, No Trick or Treat\"posters which can be downloaded from their website, and put up in windows. They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts  knocking on their doors.\nA spokesman said: \"Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up, neither should they call on strangers, as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious, especially those who are elderly or living alone.\"\nThe police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . \"What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record,\" they warn. \"Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home, instead.\"\nKent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they don't know--and to remember not to frighten people.\nWarwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others.

People use \"innit\".e.g. It's hot here, isn't it?=\"It's\" hot here, innit!\n*Instead of saying very, really or completely, they use \"well\". e.g. I'm well tired.\n* \"Whatever\" means \"I don't care\". e.g. A: But the teacher says we can't leave until we've finished. B:Whatever. I'm going.\nNobody uses slang and not everybody likes it. A school in Sheffield, in the north of England, recently instructed its pupils to stop using slang words. The head teacher says that if young people learn to speak 'correctly' this will help them get a good job.\nWhen British people use slang, it's no surprise that some students say they can't understand native speakers.

It's these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals' ability to connect,\" says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University.\n\"But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage,\" Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:\nShy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.\nShy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation. \n Question: In the opinion of C. Barr Taylor, we should  _  . \n Options: (A) think positively of shyness (B)  try to get rid of shyness (C)  attempt to be a little shy (D)  often help those shy people",

After the call, my whole body became feverish and panicky. The time from his call to the next morning seemed like years. The whole night, I could not sleep with many _ in mind. One of them was to call the principal with regret and tell him that I could not come. Finally, I gathered some courage. I thought, \"If I miss this opportunity, surely the school will never invite me again to any of their programs.\"\nI reached the school in time. Before my turn came, my whole body was trembling. When my turn came and I started speaking, my heartbeat increased and my mouth went dry. I wasn't even able to read the written speech properly. I was not aware of where I was standing and what I was reading. That was the day when I realized my biggest weakness, Public Speaking.\nAfter my speech, I met with the principal and explained what happened to me. He told me that this happens to everyone. Even great speaker, faced the same things when they started. He suggested that I come again next time.\nAround one month later, I was invited to refer to a topic on Motivation. This time I was feeling comfortable. My speech was not only appreciated by the principal as well as the teachers, because I was able to get my idea across to them. They encouraged and praised my efforts.\nAfter delivering is successfully, I became more confident .l said to myself, \"If I can speak in front of such a learned audience, like the principal who educates others, I can now speak in front of others too.\"\nI started delivering lectures in my plant, on various topics like Self Motivation, Personality Development, Personal Excellence, Spoken English and Presentation Skills.

The advantages are obvious; they  firm the soil, soak up   extra water and take carbon dioxide   out of the atmosphere.\nHowever, it now turns out that planting trees could add to global warming.\nTree roots do a great job of keeping soil firmly on the ground and out of the wind's power. The problem is that some of those dust clouds play an important part in soaking up carbon dioxide.\nHuge dust storms blow out over the oceans from dry parts of North Africa and central Asia. Tons of dust are lifted and left as a thin film over the ocean surface. The dust fuels oceanic life.\nDust from China is carried east and left in the Pacific Ocean. If a tree-planting programme there is successful and the dust supply reduced, the net result may be that less carbon dioxide gets locked away in the ocean.\nAndy Ridgwell, an environmental scientist from the University of East Anglia, has spent the past few years studying dust and says his work \"shows clearly the complexity of the system and the importance of not tinkering  with it without understanding the results. For this reason there is the need to focus  on cutting carbon dioxide giving off rather than monkeying   about with the land surface.\"\nAn American scientist, Robert Jackson, has shown that when native grassland areas are invaded  by trees, carbon is lost from the soil. \"We are studying why the soil carbon disappears, but one theory is that trees do a lot more of their growing above ground compared to grasses, so less carbon goes directly into the soil from trees, \" says Jackson.\nIn wet areas of the world, the gain from trees absorbing carbon dioxide above ground seems to be outweighed  by the loss of carbon from the soil below ground. Countries that plan to _ global warming by planting trees may have to think again. Solutions  to environmental problems are often more complex than they first appear, and understanding the Earth's climate is a very great challenge. \n Question: Robert Jackson's experiment proves that \n Options: (A) grassland areas should be covered by forests (B)  trees hold more carbon than grass (C)  carbon can turn grass into dust (D)  less carbon can make trees grow faster",

I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity  can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn't been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don't mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.\nLife, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. The adjustment is never easy. I was totally confused and afraid. But I was lucky. My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.\nThe hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance  that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that somewhere in the sweeping, intricate  pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit.\nIt took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the simplest things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. \"I can't use this.\" I said. \"Take it with you,\" he urged me, \"and roll it around.\" The words stuck in my head. \"Roll it around! \"By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia's Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.\nAll my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress. \n Question: What's the most difficult thing for the author? \n Options: (A) How to adjust himself to reality. (B)  Building up assurance that he can find his place in life. (C)  Learning to manage his life alone. (D)  How to invent a successful variation of baseball.",

However,on one particular Saturday morning I learnt something perhaps more important.\nThe hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and some people could only pay for the most basic treatments. On this Saturday,a man and his young son,who was probably about 7 years old,walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. There was something wrong with the cat's left eye. But the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine. He kept quiet for a while,and then he asked where the nearest animal shelter was. Hearing this,his son cried and started to argue with him. All of a sudden,an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up,walked up to the counter,and told the man that she would pay for the cost. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat.\nI always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person,but I only saw people do acts of kindness on TV or in movies. What the woman did made me believe that these things do happen in real life,and quite often.\nNow,when I can't decide whether to help someone who is in need,I remember this woman,and then I have the courage to step up to the plate.

I was more organized and detailed, but he was more of a _ type. I knew that getting on the same financial page was a key factor in creating a successful marriage and financial future.\nI asked my husband if he would be willing to set up a time each week to talk about our finances and develop a plan for getting rid of our credit card debt. My husband said he would be willing to do this. Admittedly, he was skeptical -- but willing.\nWe came to refer to our weekly meetings as our Financial Dates. We didn't really have a clue as to what we were doing. All we knew was that we needed to give our finances serious attention. Some Dates were filled with tense conversations. Other Dates were filled with laughter, joy and creativity. However, we kept showing up for our Dates and we never gave up.

Well,to some extent it is a reflection of our melting pot culture,meaning that Europeans made huge contributions in the form of wheat,dairy products,pork,beef and poultry.But American cuisine also includes products that once were known only to the New World,including potatoes,corn,pumpkin,sweet potatoes,and peanuts.\nThe one region of the country where you still find all these things in daily use is the Deep South.The South lost the Civil War,but children of the southerners are winning the battle to preserve and advance their cooking traditions--and in this case one of the few cuisines can truly be called American,which is why we're pleased to have Low Country cuisine in this issue of food creation.That's right,grits and gravy are back in a big way in cities like Charleston and Savannah.Truth is,they never really left,but up until a decade ago Low Country cuisine was more common at home than in restaurants.\nIn fact,a large number of tourists now go to the lower Atlantic region in order to experience this extraordinary cuisine for themselves.Time will tell whether Low Country cuisine becomes popular in other regions of the country in the way that,say,Italian cuisine has,but it's amazing and heartening to see one of our true cultural treasures enjoying renewed popularity in these increasingly homogeneous times. \n Question: What's the writer's attitude towards the renewal of Low Country cuisine in America? \n Options: (A) Concerned and cautious.

They don't want to be \"tourists\". They want to have an adventure-- a surprising and exciting trip. They want to learn something and maybe help people too. How can they do this? Some travel companies and environmental groups are planning special adventures. Sometimes these trips are difficult and full of the world. Some volunteers spend two weeks and study the environment. Others work with animals. Others learn about people of the past.\nWould you like an adventure in the Far North? A team of volunteers is leaving from Murmansk, Russia. The leader of this trip is a professor from Alaska. He's worried about chemicals from factories. He and the volunteers will study this pollution in the environment. If you like exercise and cold weather, this is a good trip for you. Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day. -\nDo you enjoy ocean animals? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii. There, you can teach language to dolphins. Dolphins can follow orders such as \"Bring me the large ball\". They also understand opposites. How much more can they understand? It will be exciting to learn about these _ animals. Another study trip goes to Washington State and follows orcas. We call orcas \"Killer Whale\", but they' re really dolphins--the largest kind of dolphin.. These beautiful animals travel together in family groups. They move through the ocean with their mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. Ocean pollution is chasing their lives. Earthwatch is studying how this happens.\nAre you interested in history? Then Greece is the place for your adventure. Thirty-five hundred years ago a volcano exploded there, on Santorini. This explosion was more terrible than Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens. But today we know a lot about the way of life of the people from that time. There are houses, kitchens, and paintings as interesting as those in Pompei. Today teams of volunteers are learning more about people from the past.\nDo you want a very different vacation? Do you want to travel far, work hard and learn a lot? Then an Earthwatch vacation is for you. \n Question: If you want to learn something about people of the past,  you can   _ \n Options: (A) join the team to Hawaii (B)  join the team to the Far North (C)  join the team to Washington (D)  join the team to Greece",

During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire. \n Question: The passage mainly   _  . \n Options: (A) explains the saying \"All roads lead to Rome\" (B)  praises ancient Romans for their great achievements (C)  shows how great the Roman Empire was (D)  introduces the construction of the Roman roads",

If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.\nStepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path. \n Question: The best title of the passage should be   _  . \n Options: (A) Flower Gardens in Holland (B)  Comfort or Growth (C)  Personal Development (D)  The Topping Approach",

On May 1, there were constant traffic jams on highways leading out of the several metropolises, the longest, according to reports, was 55 kilometers. Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays.

So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom.

Mr. Keeling did not follow her.\nThe detective went quickly to the policeman's house. Then the two men hurried to the jewellery store. They looked through the window. The policeman was surprised. He spoke to Mr. Keeling, \"I don't understand. You told me, 'Robbins took a young woman to a restaurant.' Where is she?\"\n\"There she is!\" said Mr. Keeling. He pointed through the window.\n\"Do you know the lady with Robbins?\" asked the policeman.\n\"That's his secret friend,\" said Mr. Keeling.\n\"No! You're wrong! That's Robbins' wife,\" said the policeman. \"I've known her for fifteen years.\"\n\"What?\" the detective shouted. His face became pale. \"Who is under the table in the store?\" He started to kick the door of the jewellery store. Mr. Robbins came to the door and opened it. The policeman and the detective ran into the store.\n\"Look under that table!\" shouted the detective. \"Be quick!\"\nThe policeman lifted the cloth and put his arm under the table. He pulled out a black dress, a black veil and a woman's wig .\n\"Is this young lady your wife?\" Mr. Keeling asked the jeweller. He pointed at the woman.\n\"Yes! She is my wife!\" said Mr. Robbins angrily. \"Why did you kick my door? Why are those clothes under my table?\"\n\"Please check all the jewellery in your store, Mr. Robbins,\" the policeman said. \"Is anything missing?\"\nSome diamond rings and some expensive necklaces were missing. The missing jewellery was worth $800. Later that night, Mr. Keeling was sitting in his office. He was looking through a big book of photographs. They were photographs of criminals. The policeman had brought the book to the detective's office. Suddenly, Mr. Keeling stopped turning the pages. He looked at a picture of a handsome young man with a familiar face.\nThe next morning, Mr. Keeling paid the jeweller $800, then closed his office. \n Question: The missing jewellery worth$800 was in fact taken away by   _  . \n Options: (A) a young woman (B)  a young man (C)  a detective (D)  a policeman",

Add two pieces of advanced 21stcentury technology -- global positioning system (GPS) devices and the Internet -- to get \"geocaching\".\nThe word geocaching comes from \"geo\" (earth) and \"cache\" (hidden storage). Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public. Using an inexpensive GPS device, anyone on earth can send a signal to the satellites and receive information about their position. This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area. As for the content of the caches, owners and finders must only use items that are suitable for the whole family, as caches are found by geocachers of all ages. \n Question: How can finders learn about the cache owners? \n Options: (A) By meeting them. (B)  By going to a website. (C)  From the notebook. (D)  From the satellite.",

Well,to some extent it is a reflection of our melting pot culture,meaning that Europeans made huge contributions in the form of wheat,dairy products,pork,beef and poultry.But American cuisine also includes products that once were known only to the New World,including potatoes,corn,pumpkin,sweet potatoes,and peanuts.\nThe one region of the country where you still find all these things in daily use is the Deep South.The South lost the Civil War,but children of the southerners are winning the battle to preserve and advance their cooking traditions--and in this case one of the few cuisines can truly be called American,which is why we're pleased to have Low Country cuisine in this issue of food creation.That's right,grits and gravy are back in a big way in cities like Charleston and Savannah.Truth is,they never really left,but up until a decade ago Low Country cuisine was more common at home than in restaurants.\nIn fact,a large number of tourists now go to the lower Atlantic region in order to experience this extraordinary cuisine for themselves.Time will tell whether Low Country cuisine becomes popular in other regions of the country in the way that,say,Italian cuisine has,but it's amazing and heartening to see one of our true cultural treasures enjoying renewed popularity in these increasingly homogeneous times. \n Question: From the passage,we know that grits and gravy   _  . \n Options: (A) were cooked with new materials after the Civil War (B)  are gaining popularity in the south of America (C)  were more popular over ten years ago (D)  are seldom served in restaurants",

Most people don't know that there is a major difference between the two foods. No one seems to be able to determine which is which, creating a lot of confusion for people who are truly concerned with buying the best and healthiest products.\nIn 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its official position on organic foods and made its production controlled by a strict law. While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods. The most important thing to remember is to eat a variety of healthy foods, organic or natural foods. Eating more fruits, vegetables, low-fat and whole grains will be good for our health. \n Question: What can be used in growing organic foods? \n Options: (A) Chemical things. (B)  Antibiotics.

While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect. Terry Root, an animal expert at Stanford University, said, \"I do think what we will be facing is the extinction of many species.\" \n Question: Why can't marmots find enough food when they wake up? \n Options: (A) Because there are too many marmots in the wild now. (B)  Because more and more animal species skip hibernation now. (C)  Because winter days end much earlier than before. (D)  \"Because plants havent received enough sunlight for spring growth.\"",

That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students. \n Question: With the distance-learning program, Arizona State University is able to   _  . \n Options: (A) enroll 40% of its students online (B)  keep costs down without a loss of quality (C)  provide an even greater number of courses (D)  attract the most gifted students all over the world",

He visits sick people by plane.\nWhen someone is very sick, the doctor has to fly to the person's home. His plane lands on a flat piece of ground near the person's house. Sometimes the doctor has to take the patient to hospital. Flying doctors take about 8,600 people to hospital each year.\nHowever, most of the time the person isn't very sick, and the doctor doesn't have to visit. He can give advice on the radio from the office at the flying doctor center. He can tell the patient to use some medicine from a special medicine chest  .

It is estimated that almost 630,000 people died from malaria and malariarelated causes in 2012, and most of these cases were in African countries.\nIn the United States, a group of California scientists are working to develop a more effective and less costly substance   to protect people from mosquitoes. The researchers are investigating the sense of smell in mosquitoes. They found the insects use the same _ for identifying carbon dioxide in human breath as they do for the smell of our skin. Anandasankar Ray, who is leading the investigation, says scientists tested more than a million chemical compounds   until they found a substance called Ethyl Pyruvate. He says Ethyl Pyruvate makes the mosquitoes' receptors inactive. \"When we apply Ethyl Pyruvate to a human arm and offer it to hungry mosquitoes in a cage, very few of the mosquitoes are attracted to the human arm because only a few of them are able to smell it out,\" said Ray.\nGenevieve Tauxe, a member of the research team, says it was not easy to find the neurons   of noble cells that recognize both the smell of human breath and skin. \"With the device used to examine the mosquito, we are able to insert a very small electrode   into the part of the mosquito's nose, where its smelling neurons are and where the smell is happening,\" said Tauxe.\nAnandasankar Ray says a product based on Ethyl Pyruvate may cost less to produce than DEFT, the most effective chemical treatment now in use. He says DEFT is too costly for most people who live in areas affected by malaria.\n\"Perhaps by finding smells that can attack other target receptors, we will be able to improve upon DEFT and finally have the next generation of insect behaviour control products,\" said Ray. \n Question: Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? \n Options: (A) Ethyl Pyruvate--an Insect Behaviour Control Product (B)  Malaria--a Serious Disease Causing 630,000 Deaths (C)  Scientists Find a New Substance to Fight Mosquitoes (D)  A New Generation of DEET Has Been Developed to Kill Mosquitoes",

Another view is that English is already breaking up into several separate languages.

Tall and thin, she sits shaking in a yellow T-shirt at the Al Marj settlement, close to the Lebanese-Syrian border.\nHome for Rabia was once a two-story house near Damascus. Now it is a tent shared with her nine family members.\nRabia's face is covered with dirt, and she is tired and cold. She has just finished work, picking up potatoes that fell from a truck. Her typical day starts at 4 a.m., and she works a double _ that lasts about 16 hours, putting potatoes into bags. The only choice for her is that she can choose the first eight hours or the second eight hours. For this, she gets paid about $8 a day.\nWorking means Rabia misses school. Back in her village, she was the best in her class and good at everything. Her favorite subjects were Arabic literature and math. But, like many children now living in the settlements -- there are no official refugee camps in Lebanon -- that was Rabia's old life. Life before war, before her family moved five times to escape the bombs, before leaving behind her bedroom, her toys and her friends without packing a bag, before \"half the people I know\" were dead.\nThe old life was full of laughter with her sister, Wala. But Wala, 14, got married two days ago to an 18-year-old Lebanese. Rabia is happy for her sister. Life in the settlement is tough -- the children have nowhere to play, the bathing is poor and sexual abuse is out of control. You can't blame parents -- often confused, illiterate and poor -- who want to marry off their daughters. They fear for their safety.\nIncreasing numbers of Rabia's girlfriends are getting married. Once in rural Syria, a girl got married at 16. According to UNICEF, the age is now dropping to 12 or 13.

That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students. \n Question: The fourth wave of change in America's higher education refers to   _  . \n Options: (A) public colleges (B)  land-grant schools (C)  research universities (D)  initial higher education",

Before dinner, the hostess usually serves guests first and herself last. So do not eat as soon as you are served but wait until the hostess has also been served and has picked up her fork as the signal to begin. But at a large dinner party where there are many guests, the hostess may ask everyone to begin eating as soon as they are served. If you want to talk while eating, your mouth should certainly not be full of food because it is considered very bad manners. But it is possible to speak with a little food in the mouth. When you have to answer a question, naturally you must wait until the food in your mouth is eaten.\nWhen a dish is passed to you with a fork in the plate, you should use it to take your food. Do not take too much at a time and make sure that the other guests can have enough food.\nAnyway, good table manners are very important and they are not so simple as we thought.

What we must remember, however, is not merely how powerful character is in influencing our fate  , but how powerful we are in shaping our own character and, therefore, our own fate. Character may determine our fate, but character is not determined by fate.\nIt's a common mistake to think of character as something that is fully formed and fixed very early in life. It calls to mind old proverbs like \"A leopard can't change its spots\" and \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\"\nThis perspective that our character is \"etched in stone\" is supported by a great deal of modern psychology emphasizing self-acceptance. As Popeye says, \"I am what I am.\" The hidden message is:Don't expect me to be more, better, or different.\nUltimately, these views of humanity totally undervalue the lifelong potential for growth that comes with the power of reflection and choice.\nHow depressing it would be to believe that we can't choose to be better, more honest, more respectful, more responsible, and more caring. None of us should give up the personal seeking to improve our character. Not because we're bad, we don't have to be sick to get better , but because we're not as good as we could be.\nThere are so many things in life we can't control, whether we're beautiful or smart, whether we had good parents or bad, whether we grew up with affirmation or negation. It's inspiring to remember that nothing but moral will power is needed to make us better.\nNo, it isn't easy. But if we make a great effort to become more aware of the habits of heart and mind that drive our behavior, we can begin to place new emphasis on our higher values so that we become what we want our children to think we are. \n Question: What can we infer from the passage? \n Options: (A) It is not difficult to improve ourselves. (B)  We must try our best to be as good as possible. (C)  Our children should copy our behavior. (D)  We should control as many things as possible in life.",

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing.\nOliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth. One was an old woman, who was nearly always drunk, and the other was a busy local doctor, who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival.  _ \nHowever, Oliver managed to draw his first breath, and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly. His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered, \"Let me see the child, and die.\"\nThe doctor turned away from the fire, where he had been warming his hands. \"You must not talk about dying yet,\" he said to her kindly. He gave her the child to hold. Lovingly, she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips, then stared wildly around the room, fell back--and died. \"Poor dear!\" said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.\nThe doctor began to put on his coat. \"The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties,\" he said. \"If so, give it a little milk to keep it quiet.\" Then he looked at the dead woman. \"The mother was a good-looking girl. Where did she come from?\"\n\"She was brought here last night,\" replied the old woman. \"She was found lying in the street. She'd walked some distance, judging by her shoes, which were worn to pieces. Where she came from, where she was going to, or what her name was, nobody knows.\"\nThe doctor lifted the girl's left hand. \"The old story,\" he said sadly, shaking his head. \"No wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night.\"\nAnd so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse. Without clothes, under his first blanket, he could have been the child of a king or a beggar. But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked. \n Question: It can be inferred that the gate of the baby farm was always kept locked in order to   _  . \n Options: (A) protect the children inside from dangers outside (B)  prevent official visitors walking in unexpectedly (C)  keep the children inside working all the time (D)  ensure the children were always neat and clean",

That's why university rankings play such a vital role in students searching for their next academic direction. Rankings are also an inescapable part of the reputation and brand image of universities. \"No university website is complete without the claim to be in the top 100 for something or other,\" reported the BBC. The reason is simple: Rankings help them to attract students, staff and research investment.\nCurrently there are numbers of university rankings, and each has its own list of criteria. But the main categories are the same: academic reputation, graduates' performance and faculty resources.\nHowever, experts point out the ranking process isn't entirely reliable. Mark Kantrowitz, a US financial aid researcher, said university rankings were mostly just for show. He wrote in The New York Times. \"It may give your parents better bragging rights, but that's about it.\"\nMoreover, it's not difficult to see the limitations of university rankings. Many rankings focus on the number of times research work is cited   by other researchers. _ helps British and US universities to dominate global rankings because English is the favored language of academia, John O'Leary, a member of the QS academic advisory board, told The Gunrdian. Also, rankings such as QS mainly focus on the qualities of the university rather than its students. \"Any university ranking is likely to help students make better decisions about where to study, but the need to balance them with other more human factors is also important,\" said Phil Moss, an education and admissions consultant. \"Advice from graduates or current students can be as valuable in providing a genuine insight into the experience or quality of a particular degree program. It can also add an element that rankings can never convey -- the actual emotion of a university experience.\" \n Question: Besides ranking, what does Phil Moss suggest you should refer to if you're picking a university? \n Options: (A) Investment in education.

            "input": "Article: The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old. By 2050, it's projected to be one out of 5. This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.\nProfessor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. \"Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly,\" he said.\nAging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained. \n Question: What is Professor Richard Lee's attitude towards population aging? \n Options: (A) Indifferent. (B)  Optimistic. (C)  Negative. (D)  Worried.",

As the saying goes\" When in Rome, do as the Romans do\", English learners should know what the proper table manners are in western countries if invited to a dinner party. The followings are some suggestions that may be helpful to you.\nThe first important thing you need to know is when to begin eating. Before dinner, the hostess usually serves guests first and herself last. So do not eat as soon as you are served but wait until the hostess has also been served and has picked up her fork as the signal to begin. But at a large dinner party where there are many guests, the hostess may ask everyone to begin eating as soon as they are served. If you want to talk while eating, your mouth should certainly not be full of food because it is considered very bad manners. But it is possible to speak with a little food in the mouth. When you have to answer a question, naturally you must wait until the food in your mouth is eaten.\nWhen a dish is passed to you with a fork in the plate, you should use it to take your food. Do not take too much at a time and make sure that the other guests can have enough food.\nAnyway, good table manners are very important and they are not so simple as we thought. But it is necessary for one to know what good table manners are because they can help one succeed in his life! \n Question: what is the first important thing to know at a dinner party? \n Options: (A) what to eat (B)  whether to talk (C)  when to begin eating (D)  How to use forks.",

Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea. \n Question: For the main layers of the earth, which one is right? \n Options: (A) crust, mantle, core (B)  seabed, crust, mantle (C)  seabed, mantle, core (D)  crust, seabed, core",

Maybe the night crawlers only moved at night, and now they were just lying there motionless on the hook. Dad ignored my assessment of the situation.\nWe began to pack up to leave. As we headed back to our truck, we heard tires spinning in the distance. Getting into our truck was tough. Having sat in the boiling sun for six hours, the seats were blistering.

We were sure there was no way for Mom to know the difference. It was just a little white lie.\nWe arrived home hot, sweaty, and smelly, and went to clean up while Mom prepared the fish. We made a big deal out of the fact that we had already cleaned them and put them in the bag so as not to make a mess.\nAfter showering, Dad and I met in the hall and exchanged conspiratorial grins .

Mother looked suitably impressed.\nAs we got up to do the dishes, Mom cleared her throat. \"I just have one question of you two great fishermen,\" she said.

            "input": "Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much! \n Question: What is NOT true about Mumbai? \n Options: (A) It is the movie capital of India. (B)  The new name is Bombay. (C)  More movies are made there than in Hollywood. (D)  It is less expensive to make films there than in Hollywood.",

I am talking about Chinese zodiac signs . Depending on the year of your birth, each person has an animal for a sign. That's why I am a pig and my wife is a dragon. If you, like me, were born in the year of the pig, then you are brave, thoughtful and loyal. The year of the pig is filled with good fortune.\nNow let's take a closer look at this interesting animal.\nPigs were first raised by man about 9,000 years ago, and are still a very common farm animal in many parts of the world. We don't just use pigs for their meat -- almost every part of the animal is used. The hair is used for artists' brushes. The fat is used to make floor wax, rubber and plastics.\nPigs have also been important in the world of entertainment. In 1995 the film 'Babe' starred a loveable talking pig as its main character. The film won an Oscar and was nominated  for 6 more. In England you can even go to watch pig racing. A farmer, Rob Shepherd, has been raising money for charity by holding pig races on his farm. The events have been very successful. People don't just want to eat pigs, it seems!\nPigs also play an important role in the English language. For example, if someone says that he will travel to the sun one day, you can say \" _ !\" to him. Hungry? Well then, you can \"pig out\" and eat lots of food. And what if someone rescues you? Well, you can say that they \"saved your bacon\". \n Question: We may know from the passage that   _  . \n Options: (A) people in England like pigs more than other animals (B)  pigs are more useful than ordinary people imagine (C)  pigs are the first animals raised by man (D)  \"more people dont want to eat pigs now\"",

            "input": "Article: Everything in China is negotiable, so goes the saying, reminding foreign travelers to be on guard and avoid being overcharged. Foreign tourists are often advised to learn some bargaining skills so that they can avoid paying high prices. Generally speaking, bargaining is an art and an important part of people's life in China.\nBut the younger generation is gradually losing interest and the ability to negotiate a better deal. With fatter wallets, young people who never experienced war or shortages seldom bother to spend 10 minutes at a roadside shop cutting the price of a cell phone cover by 1 yuan. Saving for a rainy day and making good use of every penny---values held dear by older generations---no longer seem necessary. Naturally, bargaining is out, in an increasingly rich society. In this sense, bargaining is a product of poverty.\nBut in many countries, where residents' incomes are much lower than those in China, bargaining is not popular at all. I can still remember my failed bargaining attempts in Africa and Indonesia, where vendor  looked at me in surprise when I sought something at half the price. They shook their heads and stopped the negotiation. Latter I was told by friends who had been staying there for years that bargaining was not part of local commercial culture.\nDuring the years when the planned economy changed into the market economy, it was difficult for ordinary buyers to get a full picture of the product prices at a time when travel was inconvenient, and information spread slowly, adding to the information asymmetry . Afraid of being overcharged by vendors, buyers turned to the old wisdom of bargaining whenever and wherever they could.\nNowadays, the popularity of e-commerce has improved pricing transparence  to the extreme. With the click of a mouse, all kinds of information on a product can be found, with users' comments helping new consumers make decisions. With such transparency, overpricing becomes less frequent and bargaining is not a necessity for shoppers. In this sense, reduced bargaining activity can be seen as a sign of China's progress toward a more mature economy. \n Question: In China, the younger generation is losing interest in bargaining as a result of   _  . \n Options: (A) rising incomes (B)  an increasing number of products (C)  the value of saving for a raining day (D)  their fear of losing face",

So far, the team's members have raised $4,500. That's enough to purchase and protect more than 16 acres of rainforest in Costa Rica through the Center for Ecosystem survival.\nEvery year, thousands of square miles of rainforest are destroyed worldwide. Logging and farming are mostly likely to blame, scientists say. The loss is terrible news for animals and people. Even though rainforests cover less than 2 percent of the earth, they are home to half the world's plants and animals. Rainforests also provide water and help control the earth's climate.\nEvan's work to save the rainforests recently earned him a Barron prize for Young Heroes. The prizes are given to children or teenagers who have made a positive difference in the world. Evan's goal is \"to save enough rainforests to last forever\". He won't have to do it alone. His actions have already inspired other kids to chip in. One girl asked for donations instead of presents on her birthday. She raised $850. Other kids are starting their own conservation teams.\nEvan says everyone can help the planet-even by taking small steps such as recycling.

On the other hand, the hosts that guests write to me about have taken some extreme measures to reduce the cost of their hospitality. These range from a dinner party where a relative of the host explained how expensive the steaks were and \"rather pointedly suggested\" that the letter writer \"make a financial contribution\" to the cost of dinner, to some Cape Cod homeowners who invited a couple to spend a weekend with them -- as long as they brought their own food, bottled water, and toilet paper.\nWeddings and other special events always create extra sources of stress, worsened by the fact that people rarely want to talk honestly about their money situations. One couple chose to have only a civil wedding ceremony for financial reasons and wondered how to tell people this without going into too much detail. A sixtysomething couple needed to cut back on Christmas gifts to their children but weren't sure how to tell them about it.

Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much! \n Question: Which of the statements would the writer probably agree with? \n Options: (A) Most Bollywood movies are very similar. (B)  It takes a lot of money to make a good movie. (C)  Only Indian people can understand Bollywood movies. (D)  Hollywood movies are too short.",

Oceans cover 70 per cent of the surface of the globe and store a thousand times more heat than the atmosphere does. What's newer is the understanding of how this key component  of our climate system responds to global warming.\nA brake on global warming--for now\nOne of the oceans' most important climate functions is absorbing heat and carbon dioxide(CO2), one of the gases that causes global warming. Acting as something absorbing heat, the oceans have absorbed huge amounts of heat and CO2 in the last forty years.\nFujita explains, \"the oceans are saving us from faster climate change--they are putting a brake on the climate system.\"\n\"That's the good news,\" he adds. \"The bad news is that the oceans only slow the atmospheric warming.

And as the ocean stores heat, fragile  underwater ecosystems are struggling.\nThe most recent scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) also notes with concern that the ocean is acidifying  because of increased absorption of atmospheric CO2. and thus causing a threat to shell-forming species.  Sharp increase in CO2 levels will cause further acidification of the ocean.\nCurrents distributing heat\nAnother important role the oceans play is that of distributor . Oceans deliver heat and life-sustaining nutrition around the globe. Just as blood tube bring oxygen and nutrition to cells in the human body, the ocean's currents carry oxygen, nutrients and heat throughout the Earth. The ocean distributes 25 to 50 per cent of energy the planet receives from the sun. For example, the Gulf Stream carries heat across the Atlantic. This warm current gives northwestern European a milder climate that it would normally have so far north. A change to the ocean's circulation patterns could throw Europe into a colder period, even as the rest of the world is experiencing warmer temperatures. \n Question: We can infer from the passage that   _  . \n Options: (A) the oceans cause global warming (B)  the oceans stop global warming (C)  the oceans release nutrients and heat (D)  the ocean ecosystems face more dangers",

From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out. \n Question: Matthew Hopkins can be best described as   _ \n Options: (A) kind and smart (B)  tricky and merciless (C)  successful and nice (D)  famous and fortunate",

Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public.

This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area.

The body needs fruit and vegetables because they contain vitamin C. Many people take extra vitamins in pill form, believing that these will make them healthy.\nBut a good diet is made up of nourishing food and this gives all the vitamins you need. The body doesn't need or use extra vitamins, so why waste money on them?\nIn the modern western world, many people are too busy to bother about eating properly. They throw anything into their stomachs, eating hurriedly and carelessly. The list of illnesses caused or made worse by bad eating habits is frightening, \n Question: The old saying referred to in the passage tells us that   _  . \n Options: (A) eating apples regularly does lots of good to our health (B)  the apple is the best among all kinds of fruits (C)  apples can take the place of doctors (D)  an apple is a sure cure for illness",

Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by it that he decided to get one too. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.\nThe desire to be accepted by one's friends or peers can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, that person is more likely to do the same thing.\nThe media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos--people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars, famous sports heroes with tattoos in magazines, fashion models wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colorful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.\nMany people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings-in other words, to show their individuality . A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform, a sign of fashion, or an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself. For Jack, it was a mixture of all three. \n Question: We can infer from the passage that   _  . \n Options: (A) some people get tattoos out of pressure (B)  tattoo is related to religious belief (C)  getting tattoos costs a lot of money (D)  most people with tattoos are artists",

It was because Loona Bimberton had recently taken a plane to the forest and killed a tiger, and the newspapers showed photographs of Loona Bimberton with a tiger-skin on. In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\"\nMiss Mebbin possessed the pretty weekend cottage. Mrs. Packletide lost interest in animal-hunting.\n\"The extra expenses are so heavy,\" she said to inquiring friends. \n Question: The Indian villagers were afraid that the tiger might   _  . \n Options: (A) eat their goats (B)  kill their kids (C)  die of old age (D)  attack them at night",

If you do, I'm not alone.\nLive performances at theaters interest different groups of people from rich people to office workers. If you go to any theater and look at its audience, you will find it is made up of teenagers, the elderly and anyone in between. One part of it is due to the marketing and the show itself. For example, Hair isn't going to interest the same audience as My Fair Lady. Another part of it is due to the area in which you live. The Palace Theater in Manchester, for example, interests a more urban  crowd than the Leddy Center in Epping. All of these people have an interest in the magic of live performances and they go to the theater for different reasons.\nThere is nothing better than live theatre performances to increase your cultural awareness   When you go to see a live theater performance, no matter whether it is a musical or a play, you are improving your knowledge of the world around you. Some people go to the theater to have fun and escape their troubles; others, particularly rich people, go to the theater to develop their knowledge of the world around them. Both of them are very good reasons for going to see live theater performances. However, personally, I often go to the theater more to have fun than anything else.\nEveryone has the right to enjoy any performance, whether it's a world-famous performance by the New Hampshire Ballet or a second-rate performance by your local community theater. The main thing to remember is whether you are there to heighten your awareness of the culture or to get away from your problems. You should appreciate the performance for what it is, because too many people these days don't know enough about the arts. \n Question: What does the author mean by saying she is not alone? \n Options: (A) She no longer feels lonely.

During the Great Depression  , work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. On weekends he and Grandma dug a garden to grow some of their own food.\nEverybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food and enjoyed flowers from the garden. Grandma put up strawberry jam, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches in canning jars. They were good to eat through the long winter.\nThe family grew up, and grandparents grew old. It became hard to keep up the garden, so they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy.\nThen one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was watch from his lawn chair as the vegetables grew and the roses bloomed. Summer slowly faded, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest.\nIt was a lonely winter for Grandma. She sat near the window, looking out at the yard and wondering if she could plant a garden in the spring. When spring came, she planted only a little garden.\nOne sunny day in the early summer, Grandma heard a commotion   in the front yard and looked out the window to see a frightening sight. A huge swarm of bees filled the air between two tall trees. The buzzing sound was very loud.\nThe bees made their way into a hole up in one of the trees. Before long, every one of those bees had disappeared into its new home. During the next few days, the bees were busy minding their own business. Grandma could always see a few bees buzzing in and out around the opening high in the tree. Before long, she decided the bees weren't bothering anyone, so she didn't give them another thought.\nThat summer, Grandma's little garden grew and grew. _ \nOne day, Grandma's brother Frank visited from Arizona. As Grandma made Frank a delicious lunch of squash cakes and homemade applesauce, she told him the story about the swarm of bees. Frank said, \"In Arizona, the farmers often hired beekeepers to set up beehives near their fields.

We were hot, sticky, and mad that the fish refused to suck up our night crawlers .\nBeing only seven years old, I observed that perhaps the worms were the problem. Maybe the night crawlers only moved at night, and now they were just lying there motionless on the hook. Dad ignored my assessment of the situation.\nWe began to pack up to leave. As we headed back to our truck, we heard tires spinning in the distance. Getting into our truck was tough. Having sat in the boiling sun for six hours, the seats were blistering. Naturally, I was wearing shorts.\nI shifted from side to side in the seat so as not to cook my bottom. While driving out we saw a truck with a boat trailer and boat that was stuck in the mud. That explained the sound of spinning tires we'd heard.\nBeing a nice guy, my dad helped pull the man from the mud. In return, this fellow gave Dad some fish for being a Good Samaritan. As Dad climbed back into our truck with a brown bag full of fish, we waved goodbye to our newfound friend.\nOn the drive home, we agreed to take in the fish as if we had caught them. We were sure there was no way for Mom to know the difference. It was just a little white lie.\nWe arrived home hot, sweaty, and smelly, and went to clean up while Mom prepared the fish. We made a big deal out of the fact that we had already cleaned them and put them in the bag so as not to make a mess.\nAfter showering, Dad and I met in the hall and exchanged conspiratorial grins . Sitting down to freshly fried fish, we started eating happily and went on about how good something tasted that we had actually caught ourselves. Mother looked suitably impressed.\nAs we got up to do the dishes, Mom cleared her throat. \"I just have one question of you two great fishermen,\" she said. We looked at her expectantly, thinking we had another opportunity to delight her with our great fishing ability. With a tiny smile, Mom asked, \"How was it again that you two managed to not only clean your fish, but also freeze them before you got home.\" \n Question: Mom smiled at the end because she   _  . \n Options: (A) was amused by the little white lie (B)  was satisfied with their fishing ability (C)  was impressed that the fish were clean and frozen (D)  was delighted that she did not need to deal with the mess",

Most people don't know that there is a major difference between the two foods. No one seems to be able to determine which is which, creating a lot of confusion for people who are truly concerned with buying the best and healthiest products.\nIn 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its official position on organic foods and made its production controlled by a strict law. While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods. The most important thing to remember is to eat a variety of healthy foods, organic or natural foods. Eating more fruits, vegetables, low-fat and whole grains will be good for our health. \n Question: The passage is developed   _  . \n Options: (A) by space (B)  by comparison (C)  by process (D)  by time",

They must be quarantined   before they can be grown. Why? Cocoa production hit a record high of 4.4 million tons last year but about 30% of the precious crop is regularly lost to pests and diseases. Now we don't want that, do we?\nDemand for chocolate has been increasing faster than the world supply of cocoa and researchers think that new varieties are key to solving this problem.\nThe University of Reading has been protecting the quality of the new crop since 1985, after it took over the task from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, London. And it has improved its facilities. The leader of the institution's cocoa project, Professor Paul Hadley, says, \"One of the main issues concerning cocoa improvement is the supply of reliably clean, healthy, interesting cocoa material.\"\nThe cocoa centre has a collection of 400 plant varieties and their greenhouse uses a lot of energy to keep them in tropical conditions. After up to two years in quarantine, clean and safe seeds are sent to some 20 countries, including several in West Africa. That's where 75% of the cocoa used for chocolate worldwide comes from. The crop is extremely important for the local economy: it employs about two million people.\nProfessor Paul Hadley says he works with a small team of skilled technicians who look after the collection. And more of us seem to count on them now.\nThe scientist says, \"There is some concern within the industry that demand is increasing constantly, particularly in countries like China, where the standard of living is increasing and people are getting a taste for different chocolates.\" \n Question: What is the text mainly about? \n Options: (A) Safeguarding cocoa seeds.

From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire.

By the next afternoon, the chimp was as good as new!\nBiologists watching the chimp were surprised. Somehow, the plant had cured the chimp! Did the chimp know the plant would make her feel better? Or was it just a lucky accident?\nMany scientists don't think it has anything to do with luck. They're discovering that some animals seem to use plants to cure themselves. And these animals are leading scientists to new plants that could cure humans!\nDr. Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard University, agrees that animals may know something we don't know about forest plants.\nWrangham got to know chimps and their diets while studying them for three years in Tanzania. \"You must know a lot about an animal's feeding habits to know what it doesn't consider food,\" Wrangham explains. Every morning, he saw that most chimps ate fruit near their nests. Later on, they ate on leaves.\nWhen he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, Wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. Another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves.\n\"They swallowed the leaves whole,\" explains Wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. \"They seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths. They closed their eyes, wrinkled their noses and swallowed slowly. \"\nWrangham wondered what could be so good about something tasting so bad. He had a chemist analyze the leaves. He discovered that the leaves contain a red oil that kills different viruses . Later tests showed that the oil might even fight cancer and the AIDS virus!\nWhy don't the chimps chew the leaves? \"Rubbing the leaves between the tongue and the inside of the mouth might allow the chemicals to enter the bloodstream directly,\" he suggests, \"instead of going to the stomach, where they might get destroyed by acids. The chimps seem to know what they're doing.\" \n Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  . \n Options: (A) chemicals in plants help cure animals (B)  chimps cure themselves by chewing plants (C)  scientists live with chimps to study their diets (D)  Dr. Wrangham knows a lot about forest plants",

I was excited and scared and everything at the same time.\"\nThe first call came from Yale University in February.

It was, I'm sure, the county's tallest wooden structure and no one had ever been known to jump from it.\nSo it was quite a shock when our teacher, Mr. David, announced that he would dive off the high board that very afternoon.\nWord of his questionable plan was already spreading through town as Mr. David swam out to the platform. He was just _ when he got there but even from such a distance the high board seemed almost to touch the clouds. Once at the top, he paced the enormously long board, then took some deep breaths and finally stood at edge. He was going to do it.\nSeveral hundred people had gathered at the shore to watch. Mr. David stood for quite a long time, then he raised his arms, took one massive bounce and launched himself into a perfect dive. It was beautiful. He fell with perfect style for what seemed minutes. The crowd fell silent. The only sound to be heard was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air toward the water far, far below.\nBut about three quarters of the way down he seemed to have second thoughts and began suddenly to panic, waving his arms and legs like someone having a bad dream. When he was perhaps thirty feet above the water, he gave up on waving and spread his arms and legs wide, apparently hoping that it would somehow slow his fall.\nIt didn't.\nHe hit the water at over six hundred miles an hour. The impact was so loud that it made birds fly out of their trees three miles away. I don't think he entered the water at all. He just bounced off it, about fifteen feet back into the air. After that, he lay still on the surface, spinning like an autumn leaf.\nHe was brought to shore by two passing fishermen in a rowboat and placed on an old blanket where he spent the rest of the afternoon. Occasionally he accepted small sips of water, but otherwise was too shocked to speak. From head to toe, he was covered with deep red bruises.\n...\nIt was the best day of my life. \n Question: How did the writer find Mr. David's plan to jump from the diving board? \n Options: (A) Heroic.

Irish-born Campbell and Japanese Omura won half of the prize for discovering a new drug, avermectin, that has helped the battle against river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing effectiveness against other parasitic diseases. The Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, an 85-year-old female scientist, was awarded the other half of the prize for the discovery of artemisinin , a drug cure for malaria  that has saved millions of lives all over the world, especially in the developing world.\nWhen the news broke that Tu won the Nobel Prize, there were cheers as well as doubts. It also has highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the West. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it was unfair to award the prize only to Tu. Indeed, Chinese science awards are mainly presented to projects, instead of individual scientists. But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method. Li Zhenzhen, a researcher of the China Academy of Sciences said that the West believes that the advancement of science comes from individuals' creative minds.\nIn 1969, Tu started to hold a government project aimed at eliminating malaria. Tu and her teammates experimented with 380 extracts in 2,000 candidate recipes before they finally succeeded in getting the pure substance qinghaosu, later known as artemisinin.

Scientists have a name for this phenomenon: behavioral _ .\nYou've probably experienced this before: after spending enough time with another person, you might start to pick up on his or her behavior or speech habits. You might even start to develop your friend's habits without realizing it. There is a large body of literature concerning this sort of phenomenon, and it regularly happens for everything from body postures to accents to drink patterns. For example, one study found that young adults were more likely to drink their drink directly after their same-sex drinking partners, than for the two individuals to drink at their own paces.\nAnd the effect isn't limited to real-life face-to-face activities. Another study found that the same you-drink-then-I-drink pattern held even when watching a movie! In other words, people were more likely to take a drink of their drinks in a theater after watching the actors on the screen enjoy a drink. At least I don't feel so strange anymore, having picked up on Adam Carolla's \"good times\".\nNew research published today in the journalPLOS ONEindicates that the same sort of behavioral mimicry is responsible for social eating, at least among university-age women of normal weight. That's right: the young women were more likely to adjust their eating according to the eating pace of their same-sex dining companion.\nAs with most experiments, these results raise a whole new set of questions. Still, the finding that behavioral mimicry may at least partly account for eating behavior is important, and has real effects on health. The researchers note that \"as long as people don't fully recognize such important influences on intake, it will be difficult to make healthy food choices and keep a healthy diet, especially when people are exposed to the eating behavior of others\". \n Question: Which of the following is NOT an example of behavioral mimicry? \n Options: (A) A boy eats his popcorn after watching the actor eat. (B)  A boy buys a Nike shirt when he finds his desk-mate has one. (C)  A girl unconsciously sits straight just as others do. (D)  \"A girl takes on the Yorkshire accent after a months stay.\"",

A silence in a conversation may also show stubbornness, or worry. Silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable; therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap with conversation. Persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding a person's needs. &\nMany Native Americans value silence and feel it is a basic part of communicating among people, just as some traditional Chinese and Thai persons do. Therefore, when a person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops, what maybe implied  is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing. In these cultures, silence is a call for reflection.\nOther cultures may use silence in other ways, particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power. For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority.\nNurses and other care-geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing. Nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that a patient's silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily.

It also has highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the West. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it was unfair to award the prize only to Tu. Indeed, Chinese science awards are mainly presented to projects, instead of individual scientists. But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method.

People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music. We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles. When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate  their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate. In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.\nClothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years. Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to make themselves different from others.\nUnfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others.

Just like children, they adopt a \"look and learn\" approach which means they can mimic   human's actions when going about their tasks.\nBiologists and psychologists at the universities of Vienna and Oxford designed an experiment to test the theory that dogs do have the ability to copy what they see, using a simple wooden box. In the study, ten owners showed their dogs how to open the wooden box, sometimes using their heads to push a handle and sometimes using their hands.\nIn the first part of the test, five dogs were rewarded with a piece of sausage for copying their owners' actions. The other five were rewarded with food for not copying, and using other methods. With each dog the experiment was repeated hundreds of times, and the time taken for a dog to get it \"right\" on 85 percent of attempts (17 goes out of 20) was recorded. The dogs encouraged to mirror their owners reached this point almost three times sooner on average than those rewarded for not copying them.

            "input": "Article: Now scientists believe that global warming affects hibernating animals, causing them to wake up earlier. While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect. Terry Root, an animal expert at Stanford University, said, \"I do think what we will be facing is the extinction of many species.\" \n Question: Judging from recent observation, which of the following animals suffered the LEAST from shortened hibernation? \n Options: (A) Brown bears. (B)  Marmots. (C)  Some snakes in Australia. (D)  Chipmunks in the US.",

On May 1, there were constant traffic jams on highways leading out of the several metropolises, the longest, according to reports, was 55 kilometers. Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays. The measures might not prevent traffic jams, but they may at least ease the jams. \n Question: Which of the following ways can ease the jams according to the passage? \n Options: (A) People drive private cars to spend holiday. (B)  People take trains to spend their holiday. (C)  Employees can have an expense-paid vacation. (D)  People make use of public holidays to enjoy themselves.",

I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity  can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn't been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don't mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.\nLife, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. The adjustment is never easy. I was totally confused and afraid. But I was lucky. My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.\nThe hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life.

I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. \"I can't use this.\" I said. \"Take it with you,\" he urged me, \"and roll it around.\" The words stuck in my head. \"Roll it around! \"By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia's Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.\nAll my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations.

Well,to some extent it is a reflection of our melting pot culture,meaning that Europeans made huge contributions in the form of wheat,dairy products,pork,beef and poultry.But American cuisine also includes products that once were known only to the New World,including potatoes,corn,pumpkin,sweet potatoes,and peanuts.\nThe one region of the country where you still find all these things in daily use is the Deep South.The South lost the Civil War,but children of the southerners are winning the battle to preserve and advance their cooking traditions--and in this case one of the few cuisines can truly be called American,which is why we're pleased to have Low Country cuisine in this issue of food creation.That's right,grits and gravy are back in a big way in cities like Charleston and Savannah.Truth is,they never really left,but up until a decade ago Low Country cuisine was more common at home than in restaurants.\nIn fact,a large number of tourists now go to the lower Atlantic region in order to experience this extraordinary cuisine for themselves.Time will tell whether Low Country cuisine becomes popular in other regions of the country in the way that,say,Italian cuisine has,but it's amazing and heartening to see one of our true cultural treasures enjoying renewed popularity in these increasingly homogeneous times. \n Question: According to the passage,American cuisine impresses people as being   _  . \n Options: (A) dull and changeless (B)  rich and various (C)  popular and delicious (D)  disagreeable and unpleasant",

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing.\nOliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth. One was an old woman, who was nearly always drunk, and the other was a busy local doctor, who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival.  _ \nHowever, Oliver managed to draw his first breath, and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly. His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered, \"Let me see the child, and die.\"\nThe doctor turned away from the fire, where he had been warming his hands. \"You must not talk about dying yet,\" he said to her kindly. He gave her the child to hold. Lovingly, she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips, then stared wildly around the room, fell back--and died. \"Poor dear!\" said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.\nThe doctor began to put on his coat. \"The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties,\" he said. \"If so, give it a little milk to keep it quiet.\" Then he looked at the dead woman. \"The mother was a good-looking girl. Where did she come from?\"\n\"She was brought here last night,\" replied the old woman. \"She was found lying in the street. She'd walked some distance, judging by her shoes, which were worn to pieces. Where she came from, where she was going to, or what her name was, nobody knows.\"\nThe doctor lifted the girl's left hand. \"The old story,\" he said sadly, shaking his head. \"No wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night.\"\nAnd so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse. Without clothes, under his first blanket, he could have been the child of a king or a beggar. But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked. \n Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? \n Options: (A) Oliver was born into the world on a cold day. (B)  Many people, especially women, drank heavily at that time. (C)  The children in the baby farm were taken good care of. (D)  Doctors were usually paid too little for the work they did.",

It didn't take too long to realize that stories like that aren't necessarily true. In real life, you learn that glass slippers are really uncomfortable, no prince is perfect and magic doesn't always work.\nSo what do you do when the way you planned things is not the way they turned out?\nKnow that parts of your fairy tale have already been written, and sadly, there's not much you can do about those first few chapters. You didn't get the best start. Your trust was unexpectedly betrayed  . You didn't get the job. Whatever falls and failures happened in your past, there's still more to the story.\nYour life has a lot of contributors  , and you are the editor-in-chief. You take what's there and create the masterpiece  . All the good pages and the bad can come together to make a beautiful adventure.\nWhen you find yourself wishing your life was more like the fairy tales, remember that in some ways it already is. There will be dragons, bad witches, great romances, winding roads and friends to help you along the way. Live your life carefully and positively as if you are writing a long story. Whether it's a comedy, tragedy or a little of both, the pen is in your hand. How it ends is all up to you. \n Question: What is the message expressed in the passage? \n Options: (A) Be positive about life (B)  Write your own stories.

During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire. \n Question: Which of the following correctly shows the structure of the Roman roads? \n Options: (A) Paving stones\\nGravel\\nRocks & rubble\\nSand (B)  Gravel\\nRocks & rubble\\nSand (C)  Sand\\nRocks & rubble\\nGravel\\nPaving stones (D)  Sand\\nRocks & rubble\\nGravel",

You go to class in the morning, take a break for lunch and go home in the afternoon.\nThis isn't quite that simple for pupils at Royal West Academy. As if classes and homework weren't already enough, students are also required to complete a range of extracurricular activities, or ECAs.\nThe range of ECAs being offered at the school is various, including everything from guitar and jewelry-making clubs, fund-raising marches, to student committees, swimming and tennis.\n\"I love ECAs. I'm so happy we have them,\" said grade 11 student Adrienne, who is a soccer player and member of the graduation committee. \"They motivate the students, and they're a great bonding experience.

Foreign tourists are often advised to learn some bargaining skills so that they can avoid paying high prices. Generally speaking, bargaining is an art and an important part of people's life in China.\nBut the younger generation is gradually losing interest and the ability to negotiate a better deal. With fatter wallets, young people who never experienced war or shortages seldom bother to spend 10 minutes at a roadside shop cutting the price of a cell phone cover by 1 yuan. Saving for a rainy day and making good use of every penny---values held dear by older generations---no longer seem necessary. Naturally, bargaining is out, in an increasingly rich society. In this sense, bargaining is a product of poverty.\nBut in many countries, where residents' incomes are much lower than those in China, bargaining is not popular at all. I can still remember my failed bargaining attempts in Africa and Indonesia, where vendor  looked at me in surprise when I sought something at half the price. They shook their heads and stopped the negotiation. Latter I was told by friends who had been staying there for years that bargaining was not part of local commercial culture.\nDuring the years when the planned economy changed into the market economy, it was difficult for ordinary buyers to get a full picture of the product prices at a time when travel was inconvenient, and information spread slowly, adding to the information asymmetry . Afraid of being overcharged by vendors, buyers turned to the old wisdom of bargaining whenever and wherever they could.\nNowadays, the popularity of e-commerce has improved pricing transparence  to the extreme. With the click of a mouse, all kinds of information on a product can be found, with users' comments helping new consumers make decisions. With such transparency, overpricing becomes less frequent and bargaining is not a necessity for shoppers. In this sense, reduced bargaining activity can be seen as a sign of China's progress toward a more mature economy. \n Question: In terms of price and product information, buyers in China used to   _  . \n Options: (A) be kept in the dark (B)  know better than seller (C)  show no concern (D)  be well-informed",

This means that when they don't know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone.

They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings.

Later on, they ate on leaves.\nWhen he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, Wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. Another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves.\n\"They swallowed the leaves whole,\" explains Wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. \"They seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths.

You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market.

As Dad climbed back into our truck with a brown bag full of fish, we waved goodbye to our newfound friend.\nOn the drive home, we agreed to take in the fish as if we had caught them. We were sure there was no way for Mom to know the difference. It was just a little white lie.\nWe arrived home hot, sweaty, and smelly, and went to clean up while Mom prepared the fish. We made a big deal out of the fact that we had already cleaned them and put them in the bag so as not to make a mess.\nAfter showering, Dad and I met in the hall and exchanged conspiratorial grins . Sitting down to freshly fried fish, we started eating happily and went on about how good something tasted that we had actually caught ourselves. Mother looked suitably impressed.\nAs we got up to do the dishes, Mom cleared her throat. \"I just have one question of you two great fishermen,\" she said. We looked at her expectantly, thinking we had another opportunity to delight her with our great fishing ability. With a tiny smile, Mom asked, \"How was it again that you two managed to not only clean your fish, but also freeze them before you got home.\" \n Question: Why didn't the fish eat our night crawlers? \n Options: (A) The weather was too hot. (B)  The reason was not clear. (C)  The fish were not hungry. (D)  The fish only ate night crawlers alive.",

My parents are really set on my getting good grades. They study my report card the same way they examine the newspaper's stock market page. And they make me feel that I've got to live up to their expectations.\nBut often it's like each teacher acts as if his is the only subject we have. They think nothing of piling on our homework or giving surprise quizzes. Sometimes we have to take two or three tests in different subjects on the same day. I'd like to see a lot of adults I know preparing for that.\nWhen the pressure becomes too high, some kids may resort to   cheating. If you have three or four subjects to study for, you're not going to be able to devote enough time to each subject in order to be well prepared for each class. Besides, it may be the only way left to live up to your parents' expectations and compete with the top students in the class.\nEverybody knows that if you cheat, it's important not to get caught. Few things can cause more of chaos. Once, my elder brother got caught cheating on a math final. My parents acted as though he'd committed a federal crime. The assistant principal called them to school, but although the incident caused several conferences, I don't think that anybody ever really understood what my brother was going through. We're just supposed to perform outstandingly as well as always act honestly, but how many adults can actually live up to the standards they set for us?\nMy father has gotten countless traffic tickets for parking in no parking zones or for not coming to a full stop at stop signs. And you've always hearing about people who don't file their incomes tax honestly. How about all the corruption in government? Successful adults often accept dishonesty in order to achieve their business goals. Are kids the only ones who are supposed to be perfect?\nMost of my friends have cheated on tests in school at one time or another. The kids who never cheated are usually either afraid of getting caught or just don't know how to do it safely. Nobody wants to cheat. But if it's a choice of being honest or of getting a better grade, most kids will try for the latter. That may sound wrong, but we didn't make the rules, we're just trying to get by. \n Question: What is the best title of this passage? \n Options: (A) Everyone can fight a cheat!

Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students. \n Question: The teachers question their students based on ------- \n Options: (A) what they learn in the class (B)  What their parents expect (C)  The questions that are similar to those of GSEC (D)  The ability that will be used outside the classroom",

Add two pieces of advanced 21stcentury technology -- global positioning system (GPS) devices and the Internet -- to get \"geocaching\".\nThe word geocaching comes from \"geo\" (earth) and \"cache\" (hidden storage). Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public. Using an inexpensive GPS device, anyone on earth can send a signal to the satellites and receive information about their position. This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area. As for the content of the caches, owners and finders must only use items that are suitable for the whole family, as caches are found by geocachers of all ages. \n Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? \n Options: (A) Most geocachers are adults. (B)  Any item can be placed in the caches. (C)  The caches should be put in a remote place. (D)  Geocachers try to avoid damaging the environment.",

Seeing all of the signs written in Chinese, constantly overhearing long streams of spoken Chinese, and seeing the effortless fluency of some foreigners who had been there for a while, I began to doubt my own ability to speak Chinese. It's proved that things were different outside of the classroom.\nWhat really happened to me was what happens every day to Chinese language learners. I became afraid and nervous at the foreignness of the language. Something happened a few weeks later. I tried to spend a lot of time in public, and the sound of spoken Chinese was becoming more ordinary to me. Despite the fact that I had not been practicing my Chinese and I had not consulted my vocabulary flashcards. I begin to notice some words that I recognized from my courses in university.

I started studying Chinese characters and began to be able to read small blocks of text in the advertisements.

A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea. \n Question: What's the title for the passage? \n Options: (A) How to study the earth.

This discovery suggests that the red planet may have been much wetter than scientists thought and raises the possibility that the planet was once habitable.\n\"The size of the lake and the length of time and series that water was showing up implies that there may have been sufficient time for life to develop.\" NASA's Mars Exploration Program scientist Dr. Michael Meyer told Reuters.\nCuriosity collected the new data on its five-mile drive to Mount Sharp, the prime destination on its mission to study Mars' climate and geography. The rover landed in Gale Crater in August 2012.\nAfter reaching Mount Sharp in September, the rover spent two months studying rocks at the base of the three-mile-high mountain, discovering fine layers of mudstone--which tend to collect at the bottom of lakes. This shows how a mountain inside a Mars' Gale Crater might have formed.\n\"If our assumption for Mount Sharp holds up, it challenges the idea that warm and wet conditions were passing, local, or only underground on Mars,\" Dr. Ashwin Vasavada said in a written statement. \"A more radical explanation is that Mars' ancient, thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally, but so far we don't know how the atmosphere did that.\"\nVasavada said Curiosity will continue to study changes in the rock formation as it climbs Mount Sharp in the next few months, which should test the team's hypothesis.\n\"We'll also look at the chemistry of the rocks to see if the water that was once present would've been of the kind that could support microbial life, if it ever was present,\" he said in a video released by NASA. \"With only 30 vertical feet of the mountain behind us, we're sure there's a lot more to discover.\" \n Question: What does this text mainly talk about? \n Options: (A) How scientists explored Mars.

But not everyone knows about the history behind this small yet powerful symbol. The history of the wedding ring goes back not just hundreds but thousands of years. No other currently practiced wedding tradition has been around as long.\nThe Egyptians were the first recorded civilization to use the wedding ring. In Egyptianhieroglyphics  a circle represented _ . Once a woman accepted the ring she became the \"property\" of the person who gave it to her and she was in a sense \"his.\" The first wedding ring could have been made of braided grass or hay (which would have been changed often), ivory, bone, or leather.  Eventually, metal was used, but the first wedding bands werecrude  and rough. However, the sentiment  remained the same-eternal commitment and love.\nThe Egyptians wore the wedding ring on the left hand because it was believed that a vein  in the left hand went straight to the heart. This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels. If you do not buy the wedding and engagement rings as a set you will want to be sure the styles are compatible . Choose carefully because this choice will need to stand the test of eternity. \n Question: What can we infer from the passage? \n Options: (A) Men were looked upon by women for thousands years. (B)  Only women have the right to make themselves beautiful. (C)  women wore rings thousands of years earlier than men. (D)  You can have an inscription put on the inside the band.",

It's not something I'd like to do, so I was relieved to read that there's a university with a programme to safeguard the future of chocolate!\nThe University of Reading, in England, has just opened a new clearing house for all the world's new cocoa varieties. They must be quarantined   before they can be grown. Why? Cocoa production hit a record high of 4.4 million tons last year but about 30% of the precious crop is regularly lost to pests and diseases. Now we don't want that, do we?\nDemand for chocolate has been increasing faster than the world supply of cocoa and researchers think that new varieties are key to solving this problem.\nThe University of Reading has been protecting the quality of the new crop since 1985, after it took over the task from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, London. And it has improved its facilities. The leader of the institution's cocoa project, Professor Paul Hadley, says, \"One of the main issues concerning cocoa improvement is the supply of reliably clean, healthy, interesting cocoa material.\"\nThe cocoa centre has a collection of 400 plant varieties and their greenhouse uses a lot of energy to keep them in tropical conditions. After up to two years in quarantine, clean and safe seeds are sent to some 20 countries, including several in West Africa. That's where 75% of the cocoa used for chocolate worldwide comes from. The crop is extremely important for the local economy: it employs about two million people.\nProfessor Paul Hadley says he works with a small team of skilled technicians who look after the collection. And more of us seem to count on them now.\nThe scientist says, \"There is some concern within the industry that demand is increasing constantly, particularly in countries like China, where the standard of living is increasing and people are getting a taste for different chocolates.\" \n Question: What's the purpose of the text? \n Options: (A) To educate.

Instead of waiting around for opportunities, simply take the initiative and create what we want!\"\nAfter this week, I asked for his personal e-mail address and sent him e-mail sharing my views and dreams. He kindly e-mailed back simple encouragement such as \"Keep thinking and playing bigger; it's much more fun that way. Love, Jack.\" Then I got occupied with other things in life and I stopped e-mail Jack.\nA year later, my dream gradually faded. I had this idea if I got back in touch with Jack. I e-mailed him again and again but got no response. As I sat down at my computer to check my e-mail for the fifth time in 15 minutes, an inspiration came like lighting: What was I doing? Was I waiting for the prize of life? I knew I needed to do something about all this waiting. I was going to write a book, which I would call \"Waiting for Jack\"!\nIt all sounded good, but then reality hit. Some nights I cried and wanted to give up. I wrote and rewrote. Even though I could feel the fear, I did it anyway. Fortunately, three years later, Waiting for Jack turns out a best-seller on Amazon!\nWe all have a \"Jack\" for whom we wait--whether it's a person, a place or a thing.

Those who made a living by writing for other people were called scribes . \nThe work of scribes was not easy. Much of it had to be done fast in order to meet the needs of the King. the church and traders. Most of the writing was in Latin  ,but some of it was in the English of the day. And no one was quite sure how some English words should be spelled.\nOne problem was that several letters were written with short vertical strok that all looked like each other. Among them were the letters , i, u, v, m and n, Thus .five straight lines in a row might stand for uni nui uvi or mii.\nAs a result .reading was sometimes difficult, especially when the writing was done in a hurry.\nThe scribes solved the problem in part, by changing the letter u to o when it came before m. n or v. This is how sum and cum came to be written as some and come.\nAt some point, too, the scribes seemed to have decided that no English word should be ended by u or v. Thus, in time an e was added to such words as live, have, due and true. It was added, but not pronounced. \n Question: The scribes changed u before m to o because  _ \n Options: (A) the change helped them write faster (B)  om was the right order (C)  um and om had the same pronunciation (D)  the change made reading easier",

It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of \"killed.\" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and hurried to send the sad message.\nShe did not hear the story as many women have heard the same. She wept at once, with wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone.\nThere stood, facing the open window, a comfortable armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul.\nShe could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver   with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves .\nThere was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? It was too hard to name.

She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips. She said it over and over under the breath: \"free, free, free!\"\nShe did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, gentle hands folded in death; the face that had never looked at her except with love, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.\nThere would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers.\nAnd yet she had loved him--sometimes. What did it matter! What could love count for in the face of her realization.\n\"Free! Body and soul free!\" she kept whispering.\nJosephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole. \"Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill.\"\n\"Go away. I am not making myself ill.\"\nHer fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her, all sorts of days that would be her own.

It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long.\nShe arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister's begging. She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory. She held her sister's waist, and together they walked down the stairs.\nSomeone was opening the front door with a key. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one.

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Allan Friedman believes that   _  . \n Options: (A) wireless companies focus on personal privacy.

But we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. When we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . Curiosity and good listening bring us back together.\nAs I consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, I'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together. There is no need for us to be joined at the head. We are already joined by our hearts. \n Question: Which of the following best describes the author's attitude to uncertainty and confusion? \n Options: (A) Favorable. (B)  Resistant. (C)  Curious.

They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts  knocking on their doors.\nA spokesman said: \"Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up, neither should they call on strangers, as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious, especially those who are elderly or living alone.\"\nThe police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . \"What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record,\" they warn. \"Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home, instead.\"\nKent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they don't know--and to remember not to frighten people.\nWarwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others.

This discovery suggests that the red planet may have been much wetter than scientists thought and raises the possibility that the planet was once habitable.\n\"The size of the lake and the length of time and series that water was showing up implies that there may have been sufficient time for life to develop.\" NASA's Mars Exploration Program scientist Dr. Michael Meyer told Reuters.\nCuriosity collected the new data on its five-mile drive to Mount Sharp, the prime destination on its mission to study Mars' climate and geography. The rover landed in Gale Crater in August 2012.\nAfter reaching Mount Sharp in September, the rover spent two months studying rocks at the base of the three-mile-high mountain, discovering fine layers of mudstone--which tend to collect at the bottom of lakes. This shows how a mountain inside a Mars' Gale Crater might have formed.\n\"If our assumption for Mount Sharp holds up, it challenges the idea that warm and wet conditions were passing, local, or only underground on Mars,\" Dr. Ashwin Vasavada said in a written statement. \"A more radical explanation is that Mars' ancient, thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally, but so far we don't know how the atmosphere did that.\"\nVasavada said Curiosity will continue to study changes in the rock formation as it climbs Mount Sharp in the next few months, which should test the team's hypothesis.\n\"We'll also look at the chemistry of the rocks to see if the water that was once present would've been of the kind that could support microbial life, if it ever was present,\" he said in a video released by NASA. \"With only 30 vertical feet of the mountain behind us, we're sure there's a lot more to discover.\" \n Question: Where does this text probably come from? \n Options: (A) A science fiction.

Many of them are addicted to a screen either on a computer or a TV -- they seem to be living in a virtual world. They have lost touch with nature.\nBut now 400 organizations in the UK, from playgroups to the National Health Service, are encouraging children to have some \"wild time\". They want kids to swap at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. Activities such as building dens, climbing trees and playing hide and seek are just some of the things kids can do. Even if they live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park.\nChildren often need a helping hand from mum and dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go. Andy Simpson from National Health Service says, \"We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go\".\nSo despite the complicated world that young people grow up in now, it seems that going back to basics and experiencing \"nature's playground\" is what modern children need. David Bond from Project Wild Thing says, \"We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted\".\nThis might sound a bit old fashioned to you, or maybe, like me, it made you think about sticking on your boots, getting outdoors and reliving your childhood.

            "input": "Article: It is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more. But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses. \n Question: What do people generally believe about the way human minds work? \n Options: (A) People think in words and sentences. (B)  Human ideas are translated into symbols. (C)  People think by connecting threads of ideas. (D)  Human thoughts are expressed through pictures.",

When children are little we make them read aloud, before the teacher and other children, so that we can be sure they \"know\" all the words they are reading. This means that when they don't know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone. After having taught fifth-grade classes for four years, I decided to try at all costs to rid them of their fear and dislike of books, and to get them to read oftener and more adventurously.\nOne day soon after school had started, I said to them, \"Now I'm going to say something about reading that you have probably never heard a teacher say before. I would like you to read a lot of  books this year, but I want you to read them only for pleasure. I am not going to ask you questions to find out whether you understand the books or not. If you understand enough of a book to enjoy it and want to go on reading it, that's enough for me. Also I'm not going to ask you what words mean. \"\nThe children sat stunned and silent. Was this a teacher talking? One girl, who had just come to us from a school where she had had a very hard time, looked at me steadily for a long time after I had finished. Then, still looking at me, she said slowly and seriously, Mr Holt, do you really mean that?\" I said just as seriously, \"I mean every word of it.\nDuring the spring she really astonished me. One day, she was reading at her desk, From a glimpse of the illustrations I thought I knew what the book was. I said to myself, \"It can't be,\" and went to take a closer look. Sure enough, she was reading Moby Dick , in edition with woodcuts. I said, \"Don't you find parts of it rather heavy going?\" She answered, Oh, sure, but I just skip over those parts and go on to the next good part. \"\nThis is exactly what reading should be and in school so seldom is, an exciting, joyous adventure. Find something, dive into it, take the good parts, skip the bad parts, get what you can out of it, go on to something else.

Greater prosperity has meant Africans are living longer and healthier. At the same time, the birthrate remains high, at an average of 5.2 births per woman in Africa, compared with 1.6 in Europe and 2.1 in Asia. The young ages 15-24 make up about 37% of Africa's labor force but occupy 60% of the continent's total jobless, and a quarter of all young people haven't received any education, according to a 2011 report from the African Development Bank.\nThe young could be the engine that drives Africa for good or it could be its downfall if they deny education and opportunities. The World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab reminded Africa that 18 million jobs will have to be created every year just to _ Africa's current job seekers.\nWhat is also required is great investment in both education and employment, so that the young can start building businesses and developing the technologies to provide opportunities for the coming boom generation.

The answer is just as open-ended as the question itself. If they ask for someone who has inspired you, it could be anyone. It could be a grandmother, a teacher, or even a character from a movie. A lot of people will say their dad. But since you really feel it, you'll have a lot to write about.\nThere are some important things to remember.These admissions officers want good writers. You don't have to be Ernest Hemingway, but you have to be able to form an interesting story.That means revision and editing,cutting out stupid grammar mistakes,reading it over several times,leaving it for a few days and looking at it again. Whatever you do, make sure the essay is as good as possible.\nAlso,you should use exciting language and really make the reader feel the same passion as you do. It also means finding something unique about your point of view, something that other people might not think of.For example,if you want to write about your dad, you can focus on a specific anecdote about him .Admissions officers love personal stories that ring true. \n Question: When admissions officers ask who has inspired you,they mean to  _  . \n Options: (A) know about your family members (B)  understand you better (C)  find out what your father does (D)  discover your personal affairs",

While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect. Terry Root, an animal expert at Stanford University, said, \"I do think what we will be facing is the extinction of many species.\" \n Question: What is the viewpoint of the writer? \n Options: (A) Global warming will continue to get worse as time goes on. (B)  Waking up early in spring may lead to the extinction of some animals. (C)  Shortened hibernation will definitely decrease the population of animals. (D)  Animals which do not hibernate die of starvation.",

Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much! \n Question: Why are Bollywood films often called \"masala\" films? \n Options: (A) They are very popular. (B)  They show Indian culture. (C)  They are much longer than Hollywood films. (D)  They mix different styles of movies.",

He argues, \"It's a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison.\"\nBut even some members of the governor's own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won't stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids' college fees.\n\"That is the vast majority of feedback   that I'm also getting from my constituents  ,\" she says. \"You know, 'Where is the relief for the rest of the population who obey the law ?' \"\n\"I was very disappointed that the policy had been changed,\" says Gerald Gaes, who served as an expert on college programs for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the 1990s. In 1994, President Clinton stopped federal student aid programs for inmates.\nGaes says research shows that college classes actually save taxpayers' money over time, by reducing the number of inmates who break the law and wind up back in those expensive prison cells.\n\"It is cost-effective,\" he says. \"Designing prisons that way will have a long-term benefit for New York State.\" \n Question: Most of Russell's constituents believe Cuomo's proposal  _  . \n Options: (A) is unfair to middle-class families. (B)  will benefit citizens obeying laws. (C)  will be useless for improving prisons. (D)  \"is based on most taxpayers feedback.\"",

Henry was busy weighing each new bag of vegetables I selected. I gave him a bag of potatoes and he walked over to the scale and waited in line. Suddenly, a man rushed over from behind, and stepped before him, hitting him out of the way. Henry looked shocked and scared. Seeing this I left my shopping cart and walked over to Henry, saying loudly, \"Are you OK, honey? I saw what that man did to you. That was very, very wrong.\"\nWhen the man finished weighing his bag, his sudden turning around made all his onions fall to the ground. The three of us stood there, frozen for a moment. And then I bent down on my hands and knees and started collecting onions. After I handed the onions to the man, he accepted them and put them into his bag. After Henry and I picked up all the onions, the man walked away without saying anything. We didn't discuss the event until we got back in the car.\nOn the way back home, Henry said through tears, \"Mommy, I've a frustrating day. That man cut right in front of me. And we had to help him pick up his onions! Why did we do that? That didn't make any sense!\"\nI took a deep breath and said, \"Henry, that man seemed to have a very bad mood today. We should forgive him. I was also angry with the man for treating you rudely. I really wanted to kick him. But doing that doesn't make any sense. If we hadn't helped him, we might have felt good for a moment, but then I bet we would have felt really sorry for a long time. You and I have a lot of love to share. Maybe that man doesn't have much.

It contains bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products for the baby as well as nappies, bedding and a small mattress.\nWith the mattress at the bottom, the box becomes a baby's first bed. Many children, from all social backgrounds, have their first naps within the safety of the box's four cardboard walls.\nThe tradition dates back to 1938.

In the 1930s Finland was a poor country and the infant death rate was high -- 65 out of 1,000 babies died. But the figure decreased rapidly in the decades that followed.

Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students. \n Question: In Egypt, the students only concentrate on ------ \n Options: (A) listening skill (B)  speaking skill (C)  reading skill (D)  writing skill",

It was, I'm sure, the county's tallest wooden structure and no one had ever been known to jump from it.\nSo it was quite a shock when our teacher, Mr. David, announced that he would dive off the high board that very afternoon.\nWord of his questionable plan was already spreading through town as Mr. David swam out to the platform. He was just _ when he got there but even from such a distance the high board seemed almost to touch the clouds. Once at the top, he paced the enormously long board, then took some deep breaths and finally stood at edge. He was going to do it.\nSeveral hundred people had gathered at the shore to watch. Mr. David stood for quite a long time, then he raised his arms, took one massive bounce and launched himself into a perfect dive. It was beautiful. He fell with perfect style for what seemed minutes. The crowd fell silent. The only sound to be heard was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air toward the water far, far below.\nBut about three quarters of the way down he seemed to have second thoughts and began suddenly to panic, waving his arms and legs like someone having a bad dream. When he was perhaps thirty feet above the water, he gave up on waving and spread his arms and legs wide, apparently hoping that it would somehow slow his fall.\nIt didn't.\nHe hit the water at over six hundred miles an hour.

Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.\nThe desire to be accepted by one's friends or peers can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, that person is more likely to do the same thing.\nThe media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos--people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars, famous sports heroes with tattoos in magazines, fashion models wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colorful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.\nMany people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings-in other words, to show their individuality .

A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos.

It was because Loona Bimberton had recently taken a plane to the forest and killed a tiger, and the newspapers showed photographs of Loona Bimberton with a tiger-skin on. In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\"\nMiss Mebbin possessed the pretty weekend cottage. Mrs. Packletide lost interest in animal-hunting.\n\"The extra expenses are so heavy,\" she said to inquiring friends. \n Question: What was the result of Mrs. Packletide's shooting? \n Options: (A) The old tiger was shot to death. (B)  Neither the tiger nor the goat was shot. (C)  The old tiger missed being shot. (D)  Both the goat and the tiger were shot.",

            "input": "Article: It is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more. But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses. \n Question: What can we conclude from the text? \n Options: (A) Most people believe we think in symbols. (B)  Loving our own writing is scientifically reasonable. (C)  The writers and critics can never reach an agreement. (D)  Thinking and writing are different stages of mind at work.",

It is Cambodia's best-known tourist attraction and is famed for its beautiful architecture and reliefs. You'll need at least three days to fully discover the delights of this magnificent site.\nMachu Picchu, Peru\nMachu Picchu was built high in the Andes Mountains of South America by the Inca in the 15th century. Although well preserved its exact purpose is unknown. It is famous throughout the world not only for its incredible design but also for the natural beauty that surrounds it. Give yourself a week to explore this magnificent site.\nStonehenge, England\nThe entire Stonehenge site was constructed over thousands of years. But why and how it was built remains a mystery. As the weather can be pretty bleak in winter and the crowds huge in summer, we suggest autumn should be the best time to visit these monster rocks.\nPompeii, Italy\nWhen Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., Pompeii was buried under many layers of ash, preserving the city exactly as it was when the volcano erupted. Because so many objects were preserved, scientists and visitors are able to better understand daily life in the ancient Roman Empire. \n Question: When is the best time to visit Stonehenge according to the passage? \n Options: (A) Summer.

This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.\nProfessor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. \"Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly,\" he said.\nAging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained. \n Question: \"Aging\" in this text means . \n Options: (A) there are more young people than old people (B)  an increasing number of old people are dying (C)  more and more young people are growing old (D)  the percentage of old people in the world is increasing",

I began to forget words in English and to dream in Spanish and love Chilean food. I got used to not depending on expensive things for fun. Fun in Chuquicamata was being with people.

On May 1, there were constant traffic jams on highways leading out of the several metropolises, the longest, according to reports, was 55 kilometers. Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays. The measures might not prevent traffic jams, but they may at least ease the jams. \n Question: What can we infer from the passage? \n Options: (A) Traffic jams often happen on highways on national holidays. (B)  People prefer to stay at home because of traffic jams. (C)  Chinese people spent over 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013. (D)  There is nothing the government can do to prevent traffic jams.",

The rover landed in Gale Crater in August 2012.\nAfter reaching Mount Sharp in September, the rover spent two months studying rocks at the base of the three-mile-high mountain, discovering fine layers of mudstone--which tend to collect at the bottom of lakes. This shows how a mountain inside a Mars' Gale Crater might have formed.\n\"If our assumption for Mount Sharp holds up, it challenges the idea that warm and wet conditions were passing, local, or only underground on Mars,\" Dr. Ashwin Vasavada said in a written statement. \"A more radical explanation is that Mars' ancient, thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally, but so far we don't know how the atmosphere did that.\"\nVasavada said Curiosity will continue to study changes in the rock formation as it climbs Mount Sharp in the next few months, which should test the team's hypothesis.\n\"We'll also look at the chemistry of the rocks to see if the water that was once present would've been of the kind that could support microbial life, if it ever was present,\" he said in a video released by NASA. \"With only 30 vertical feet of the mountain behind us, we're sure there's a lot more to discover.\" \n Question: The discovery of the lake proves that   _  . \n Options: (A) early Mars was ripe and ready for life (B)  the climate on early Mars was hot (C)  life once existed on Mars (D)  humans can live on Mars",

This situation is common in India, the Middle East and many parts of Africa. Marriage customs around the world often differ from our own. We don't realize that people in other places often get married in very different ways--and with different motives.\nIn many countries, marriage is a practical matter. A marriage provides a safe and stable home for the husband and wife. It also joins two families, which benefits the couple's parents and makes them happy. Marriage also brings children, making sure the couple will be taken care of in old age. Because marriage is important for the whole family, some cultures don't let young people choose whom to marry.\nJust as there are many different reasons for marriage, there are also many different wedding _ . Every culture has its own ways of bringing good luck to the happy couple. In a typical Western wedding, the bride seeks good luck by wearing \"something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\" Something old represents the past. Something new represents success in the future. Something borrowed reminds the bride she can get help from her friends and family. And something blue reminds her to be true to her husband.\nIn Poland, one wedding tradition is not only lucky, but also very practical. The wedding guests pin money to the bride's dress while she is dancing. The money is meant to bring luck and to help the young couple build their new life. In Bermuda, the young couple plant a tree in the yard of their new home. Once they move in, they take good care of the tree and make it grow.

A truly good marriage is something that grows with care. \n Question: What can be the subject of this passage? \n Options: (A) People across the world get married in different ways and for different reasons.

But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses. \n Question: What do we learn from the text about those famous writers? \n Options: (A) They often regret writing poor works.

But relaxation is necessary for a healthy mind and body.\nStress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. In fact,it is not the bad thing it is often supposed to be. A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life. It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health.\nThe amount of stress a person can bear depends very much on the individual. Some people are not afraid of stressand such characters are obviously important material for managerial responsibilities. Others lose heart at the first signs of unusual difficulties. When exposed to stressin whatever formwe react both chemically and physically. In fact we make choices between \"fight\" and \"flight\" and in more ancient days the choice made the difference between life and death. The crises  we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response. It is when _ lasts long,through continued exposure to stressthat health becomes endangered. Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Since we cannot remove stress from our lives(it would be unwise to do so even if we could),we need to find ways to deal with it. \n Question: What would the passage deal with,if it were to continue? \n Options: (A) How to keep mentally fit. (B)  Why we have a tight schedule. (C)  How to handle stress correctly. (D)  How we can benefit from stress.",

Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by it that he decided to get one too. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.\nThe desire to be accepted by one's friends or peers can have a great influence on what a person does. Sometimes, wearing a tattoo can be a sign that you belong to a certain group. Gangs often use special clothes and tattoos to identify their particular group. Some of these groups wear only brand-name clothes. Others wear tattoos. When a person's friends are all doing something, that person is more likely to do the same thing.\nThe media is another big influence behind the popularity of tattoos in North America. A wide variety of media images show tattoos--people appearing in commercials selling expensive cars, famous sports heroes with tattoos in magazines, fashion models wearing designer clothes that show their bodies tattooed with detailed and colorful patterns. These media images link tattoos to ideas of wealth, success, and status. As a result, many people decide to get a tattoo for its fashion and status value.\nMany people decide to wear tattoos in order to express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings-in other words, to show their individuality . A musician in a rock band may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a person's life.\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why young North Americans get tattoos. A tattoo can be part of a group's uniform, a sign of fashion, or an expression of individuality. The decision to get a tattoo is most often a result of the influence of friends or media or the desire to express oneself. For Jack, it was a mixture of all three. \n Question: According to the passage, media images are linked to   _  . \n Options: (A) traditional lifestyle (B)  social position (C)  cultural background (D)  public interest",

Up until the 20th century, the majority of Americans lived in the countryside, in what's called --Middle America or the Heartland.\nBut research has shown that growing up in America's Heartland can put students at a disadvantage when it comes to their college education. This, in turn, can hinder (to make it difficult for something to develop or succeed) their social mobility.\nA 2015 study released by the US Department of Education investigated the gap between urban and rural college students, by concentrating on a group of high school graduates from Indiana.\nUS' national statistics had previously shown that only 27 percent of rural students enroll in college, compared to 37 percent of city kids.\nWhat the study found was that urban and rural students left high school with similar academic backgrounds. Yet, the rural students were more inclined to settle for two-year colleges or less selective universities, even though they had the potential to attend to better schools.\nThe researchers say distance heavily influenced the students' decisions. The farther rural graduates high schools were from colleges, the more likely rural graduates were to enroll in a two-year college or to undermatch with a college, the report read. Many of the rural students indicated that living close to family was a priority.\nBut the researchers also noted that resources were scarcer for the rural students. Selective universities tended to concentrate their recruitment efforts on dense, urban centers, where there were more students to meet.\nA rural teen's educational opportunities may also depend on gender. Casey Quinlan, writing for The Atlantic, notes that rural women are more likely to marry sooner. Early marriage occurs most frequently among young adults with low educational background, Quinlan said, citing a 2010 study.\nBut the problem of social mobility isn't limited to the rural population. The United States has one of the highest rates of income inequality among developed nations. And by some measures, rural residents might have an advantage.\nStanford University's 2015 Poverty and Inequality Report found that poverty was hardest to escape in the American South, and in places with high racial segregation. It concluded that urban areas actually--tend to have lower rates of social mobility than rural areas.\nThe successful children growing up in rural areas do not just ' _ ' but also generally move out. That is, they typically move to large metropolitan areas, often out of their state of birth, the report explained.\nRural areas are also hoping to give their residents a boost up the social ladder. In Kansas, graduates can get $15,000 (95,297 yuan) to pay off their student debt if they move to a rural county. They keep more money in their pockets and get to enjoy more economic freedom as a result. \n Question: From the research released by the US Department of Education, we know that   _  . \n Options: (A) the gender gap might hinder the development of the graduates in the rural area (B)  the distance outweighs the academic backgrounds in graduates decision making (C)  the social ladder gap might stop graduates from being enrolled into better colleges (D)  the racial segregation stops the graduates in the rural area getting high salary",

Well,to some extent it is a reflection of our melting pot culture,meaning that Europeans made huge contributions in the form of wheat,dairy products,pork,beef and poultry.But American cuisine also includes products that once were known only to the New World,including potatoes,corn,pumpkin,sweet potatoes,and peanuts.\nThe one region of the country where you still find all these things in daily use is the Deep South.The South lost the Civil War,but children of the southerners are winning the battle to preserve and advance their cooking traditions--and in this case one of the few cuisines can truly be called American,which is why we're pleased to have Low Country cuisine in this issue of food creation.That's right,grits and gravy are back in a big way in cities like Charleston and Savannah.Truth is,they never really left,but up until a decade ago Low Country cuisine was more common at home than in restaurants.\nIn fact,a large number of tourists now go to the lower Atlantic region in order to experience this extraordinary cuisine for themselves.Time will tell whether Low Country cuisine becomes popular in other regions of the country in the way that,say,Italian cuisine has,but it's amazing and heartening to see one of our true cultural treasures enjoying renewed popularity in these increasingly homogeneous times. \n Question: It can be seen that the writer feels regretful that   _  . \n Options: (A) cuisines of other countries play a more important role in America (B)  American cuisine has become increasingly lacking in variety (C)  American cuisine tends to vary because of immigration (D)  American cuisine is being changed by foreign cuisines",

In addition to these, there are many other superstitions that are worth knowing. Understanding them will keep you safe from evil spirits--if you believe in such things--and impress your American friends when you mention them.\nLike the superstitions in other cultures, American superstitions often involve the things important in daily life, such as health, numbers, and marriage. For example, have you ever had a cough that would not go away? According to one American superstition, you should take a piece of your hair and put it between two slices of buttered bread. Next, feed this hair sandwich to a dog and say, \"Eat well, you hound, may you be sick and I be sound.\"This will trick the evil spirits and help your cough. _ .\nIn American superstitions, the number three is very important. Often, Americans will say, \"All things come in threes.\" Three is lucky because it represents the traditional family: mother, father, and child. Therefore, gifts, letters, and guests will often arrive at your home in groups of three. However, it is also possible for bad events, like accidents and funerals, to come in threes as well.\nAnother time people pay attention to superstitions is when they get married. During a wedding, brides must wear or carry\"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"The old and borrowed things will bring luck to the person who gives them to the bride. The new and blue things will bring good fortune to the bride herself. The next time someone you know is getting married, be sure to recite this phrase.\nAs it would be unlucky to discuss one more superstition, we will wind things up here. Keep your fingers crossed, and stay lucky! \n Question: In American's view, the number three is a(n)  _  number. \n Options: (A) lucky (B)  unlucky (C)  special (D)  ordinary",

They have lost touch with nature.\nBut now 400 organizations in the UK, from playgroups to the National Health Service, are encouraging children to have some \"wild time\". They want kids to swap at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. Activities such as building dens, climbing trees and playing hide and seek are just some of the things kids can do. Even if they live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park.\nChildren often need a helping hand from mum and dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go.

But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked. \n Question: According to the passage, Mrs. Mann   _  . \n Options: (A) was mad keen on looking after children (B)  provided children with little food and few comforts (C)  beat children frequently to make them mentally strong (D)  \"cared little about Mr Bumbles abrupt appearance\"",

But for Santa Claus, and the thousands of fake Santas who impersonate  him every year, the Christmas season is time to get to work.\nAlthough  Santa Claus waits until Christmas Eve to take his famous sleigh   ride, Santa impersonators can be found at shopping malls around America throughout the six weeks leading up to December 25. \"When you see Santa talking with kids at your local mall, that's when you know Christmas really is on the way,\" says Mary Lewine of New York City.\nWith the excitement of Christmas, people often forget about the real people behind the red robes   and white beards, but being a mall Santa. is a tough job. \"There is more to it than just sitting in a chair. There is more to it than just a red suit,\" said Timothy Connaghan, who has worked as a Santa for.38 years. \"Children can really put the wear and tear on you.\"\nA recent survey showed some of the challenges that mall Santas face every year. About 90 percent of Santas claimed that children pulled their beards to see if they were real, and 60 percent said that up to ten kids cough or sneeze on them every day. Even more disturbing, one-third of the Santas admit to having children wet themselves while sitting on their laps.\nSo why would anyone take this job? For Ben Brauch, a retired high school teacher who has worked as a Santa for the last six years, the answer is simple-the children. \"I see maybe 12,000 kids in a six-week period.\nIt's hard work, but it's worth it because you get to play with kids.\" In fact, Brauch loves his job so much that he keeps his white beard long all year. \n Question: What is the best title of the text? \n Options: (A) Santa impersonators during Christmas (B)  The coming Christmas (C)  Shopping malls in America (D)  A disturbing job",

In addition to these, there are many other superstitions that are worth knowing. Understanding them will keep you safe from evil spirits--if you believe in such things--and impress your American friends when you mention them.\nLike the superstitions in other cultures, American superstitions often involve the things important in daily life, such as health, numbers, and marriage. For example, have you ever had a cough that would not go away? According to one American superstition, you should take a piece of your hair and put it between two slices of buttered bread. Next, feed this hair sandwich to a dog and say, \"Eat well, you hound, may you be sick and I be sound.\"This will trick the evil spirits and help your cough. _ .\nIn American superstitions, the number three is very important. Often, Americans will say, \"All things come in threes.\" Three is lucky because it represents the traditional family: mother, father, and child. Therefore, gifts, letters, and guests will often arrive at your home in groups of three. However, it is also possible for bad events, like accidents and funerals, to come in threes as well.\nAnother time people pay attention to superstitions is when they get married. During a wedding, brides must wear or carry\"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"The old and borrowed things will bring luck to the person who gives them to the bride. The new and blue things will bring good fortune to the bride herself. The next time someone you know is getting married, be sure to recite this phrase.\nAs it would be unlucky to discuss one more superstition, we will wind things up here. Keep your fingers crossed, and stay lucky! \n Question: On the wedding, the bride often uses old and borrowed things so as to  _  . \n Options: (A) save some money for the wedding (B)  bring good luck to the people who give them to the bride (C)  give the good luck to the bride herself (D)  pass the bad luck to others",

During the Great Depression  , work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. On weekends he and Grandma dug a garden to grow some of their own food.\nEverybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food and enjoyed flowers from the garden. Grandma put up strawberry jam, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches in canning jars. They were good to eat through the long winter.\nThe family grew up, and grandparents grew old. It became hard to keep up the garden, so they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy.\nThen one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was watch from his lawn chair as the vegetables grew and the roses bloomed. Summer slowly faded, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest.\nIt was a lonely winter for Grandma. She sat near the window, looking out at the yard and wondering if she could plant a garden in the spring. When spring came, she planted only a little garden.\nOne sunny day in the early summer, Grandma heard a commotion   in the front yard and looked out the window to see a frightening sight. A huge swarm of bees filled the air between two tall trees. The buzzing sound was very loud.\nThe bees made their way into a hole up in one of the trees. Before long, every one of those bees had disappeared into its new home. During the next few days, the bees were busy minding their own business. Grandma could always see a few bees buzzing in and out around the opening high in the tree. Before long, she decided the bees weren't bothering anyone, so she didn't give them another thought.\nThat summer, Grandma's little garden grew and grew. _ \nOne day, Grandma's brother Frank visited from Arizona. As Grandma made Frank a delicious lunch of squash cakes and homemade applesauce, she told him the story about the swarm of bees. Frank said, \"In Arizona, the farmers often hired beekeepers to set up beehives near their fields. The bees pollinated   the crops and helped them to grow.\"\nThat was when Grandma realized that her bees had helped with her garden all summer. \"So that's why my little garden had such a big crop!\" she exclaimed.\nFrom that time on, Grandma always believed that since Grandpa couldn't be there to help her that summer, he had sent the bees to take his place and make Grandma's little garden grow and grow. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true? \n Options: (A) The garden was dug by Grandparents during the Great Depression.

Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors.

Coming my way from across the parking lot was what society would consider a bum  . From the looks of him, he had no car, no home, no clean clothes, and no money. There are times when you feel generous but there are other times that you just don't want to be bothered  . This was one of those \"don't want to be bothered times.\"\n\"I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,\" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat on the seat by the bus stop but he didn't look like he could have enough money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke, \"That's a very pretty car\". He was ragged   but he had an air of dignity   around him. I said, \"thanks,\" without taking a look at him.\nHe sat there quietly for a moment. The expected begging for money never came. As the silence between us widened something inside said, \"Ask him if he needs any help.\" I was sure that he would say \"yes\". So I asked, \"Do you need any help?\" He answered in three simple words that I shall never forget. The three words shook me. \"Don't we all?\" he said.\nI was feeling successful and important, above a bum in the street, until those three words hit me. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, you need help too. However, no matter how little you have, you can give help too. \n Question: When the author first saw the bum, he planned to   _  . \n Options: (A) ignore his difficulty (B)  give him a lesson (C)  offer him some help (D)  make friends with him",

But we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. When we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . Curiosity and good listening bring us back together.\nAs I consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, I'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together. There is no need for us to be joined at the head. We are already joined by our hearts. \n Question: According to the passage, when communicating with others, most of us try to behave  _  . \n Options: (A) hesitantly and confusedly (B)  honestly and harmoniously (C)  responsibly and actively (D)  confidently and convincingly",

We have been to the California State Capital Building, the nature center, and the zoo. I have seen many interesting things, but one stands out above the rest. This morning we drove from my aunt's home to Calistoga to see California's Old Faithful Geyser . I had read about it in my book, Sightseeing in California; Where You Should Go.You have probably heard of Old Faithful, the geyser father north in Yellowstone National Park. This California geyser is sometimes called\" Little Old Faithful.\"\nWhen we arrived California's Old Faithful was only a calm pool of water. The geyser didn't look very deep. \" What's the big deal?\" I wondered. As I turned, I saw some steam rising from the water. Before I knew it, there was hot water shooting up about 60 feet into the air. We could not believe our eyes! It continued for almost three minutes.\nAunt Gloria told me that the water came from an underground river. She also said that the water temperature was about 95degC. This water can sometimes shoot 170 feet into the air.\nMy aunt said that other geysers around the world reach hotter temperatures and shoot water even higher than California's Old Faithful Geyser. I'd love to learn more about this geyser and other geysers in different countries when I get home. I'll see you soon!\nYour friend,\nBennetto \n Question: Bennetto wrote the letter mainly to  _  . \n Options: (A) talk about his holiday experiences. (B)  ask Jorge to visit Old Faithful Geyser.

This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.\nProfessor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. \"Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly,\" he said.\nAging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained. \n Question: The publicly-funded support systems in industrialized nations. \n Options: (A) are facing the risk of failing (B)  have failed to provide support for the old (C)  will be replaced by other support systems (D)  \"have greatly affected the nations economies\"",

I came across the fact that the Internet usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year. I told my wife Mac kenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most start-ups don't and I wasn't sure what to expect. Mac kenzie told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor. I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.\nI was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, \"That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.\" That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it was really a difficult choice, but finally, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. _ \nAfter much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.

These extremely informal words and expressions are known as \"slang\". Here are a few examples:\n*Instead of using different tag question like isn't it? Can't you or don't they? People use \"innit\".e.g. It's hot here, isn't it?=\"It's\" hot here, innit!\n*Instead of saying very, really or completely, they use \"well\". e.g. I'm well tired.\n* \"Whatever\" means \"I don't care\". e.g. A: But the teacher says we can't leave until we've finished. B:Whatever. I'm going.\nNobody uses slang and not everybody likes it. A school in Sheffield, in the north of England, recently instructed its pupils to stop using slang words. The head teacher says that if young people learn to speak 'correctly' this will help them get a good job.\nWhen British people use slang, it's no surprise that some students say they can't understand native speakers. But perhaps learners don't need to worry about communicating with native speakers so much. Research shows that most of the English spoken in the world today is spoken between non-native speakers of the language. In fact, when we think about \"International English\", there is no such thing as a native or non-native speaker.\nHow important is it to understand these slang words and expressions? If you watch films or TV, chat online in English, then understanding slang can be very useful. But you probably won't see much slang in your English exam though. With over seven billion people living on our planet today, it's easy to think one person's actions won't make a difference, however, from personal experience, I can say: each of us is capable of making a difference, however small, to someone's life. \n Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? \n Options: (A) It is essential to learn all the British slang (B)  Native English speakers cannot understand each other well (C)  English is used more between non-native speakers currently (D)  Young people in Britain often use the same slang words as their parents",

The effect of their grandparents' involvement was stronger compared to children from two biological parent families.\"\nThe study did not look at children who lived solely with their grandparents, though.\nThe findings have great implications for people in the United States, the authors said, because American grandparents are increasingly sharing living space with their grandchildren.

But we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. When we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . Curiosity and good listening bring us back together.\nAs I consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, I'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together.

The rover landed in Gale Crater in August 2012.\nAfter reaching Mount Sharp in September, the rover spent two months studying rocks at the base of the three-mile-high mountain, discovering fine layers of mudstone--which tend to collect at the bottom of lakes.

Add two pieces of advanced 21stcentury technology -- global positioning system (GPS) devices and the Internet -- to get \"geocaching\".\nThe word geocaching comes from \"geo\" (earth) and \"cache\" (hidden storage). Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public. Using an inexpensive GPS device, anyone on earth can send a signal to the satellites and receive information about their position. This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area.

If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.\nStepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path. \n Question: By using metaphor , the author means that the tops of flowers are   _  . \n Options: (A) personal growth (B)  his writing and speaking (C)  a stronger attempt elsewhere (D)  the first results we produce in a certain area",

            "input": "Article: The first time I heard the actual London Bridge was in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, I thought it was a joke. A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard. \n Question: What was Lake Havasu City like before 1962? \n Options: (A) It was a good place for investment. (B)  It was known for its English Village. (C)  It was a small town with no tourism. (D)  It had a population of 56,000 citizens.",

But not everyone knows about the history behind this small yet powerful symbol. The history of the wedding ring goes back not just hundreds but thousands of years. No other currently practiced wedding tradition has been around as long.\nThe Egyptians were the first recorded civilization to use the wedding ring. In Egyptianhieroglyphics  a circle represented _ . Once a woman accepted the ring she became the \"property\" of the person who gave it to her and she was in a sense \"his.\" The first wedding ring could have been made of braided grass or hay (which would have been changed often), ivory, bone, or leather.  Eventually, metal was used, but the first wedding bands werecrude  and rough. However, the sentiment  remained the same-eternal commitment and love.\nThe Egyptians wore the wedding ring on the left hand because it was believed that a vein  in the left hand went straight to the heart. This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels. If you do not buy the wedding and engagement rings as a set you will want to be sure the styles are compatible . Choose carefully because this choice will need to stand the test of eternity. \n Question: What would be the best title for this passage? \n Options: (A) History of rings (B)  Interesting facts about rings (C)  Different beliefs about rings (D)  The meaning of the rings.",

But many people think it's just harmless fun.\nBut is it harmless fun?\nPolice forces across Britain are giving warnings about Halloween night. They are asking all those wishing to celebrate Halloween this year to respect those who don't want to join in.\nSome forces, like West Mercia Police, have produced \"Sorry, No Trick or Treat\"posters which can be downloaded from their website, and put up in windows. They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts  knocking on their doors.\nA spokesman said: \"Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up, neither should they call on strangers, as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious, especially those who are elderly or living alone.\"\nThe police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . \"What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record,\" they warn. \"Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home, instead.\"\nKent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they don't know--and to remember not to frighten people.\nWarwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others.

When it comes to taking selfies , knowing the following tips can directly affect the quality of your final product. .\nThe use of light is vital to improving image quality. Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast. Some apps offer useful filters, which can change your skin tone and eliminate pimples   on your face. \n Question: To get an image of high quality, you need to   _  . \n Options: (A) be under the light source (B)  be against the main light (C)  face the main light source (D)  have the photo fully exposed",

The followings are some suggestions that may be helpful to you.\nThe first important thing you need to know is when to begin eating.

It was because Loona Bimberton had recently taken a plane to the forest and killed a tiger, and the newspapers showed photographs of Loona Bimberton with a tiger-skin on. In a world supposed to be moved by hunger and by love, Mrs. Packletide's movements were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\nCircumstances proved favorable. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees   for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without risk or effort, and it happened that an old tiger was frequently coming to a neighboring village at night. He was so old that he couldn't kill animals in the wild and just satisfied his appetite to the smaller household animals. The villagers were eager to earn the thousand rupees; children were posted night and day in the jungle to watch the tiger, and the cheap goats were left about to keep him from going elsewhere. The one great fear was that he should die of old age before the day of Mrs. Packletide's shoot.\nThe great night arrived. A platform had been built in a tree, on which sat Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat with a loud bleat   was tied down at the correct distance. With an accurate gun, they waited for the coming of the tiger.\n\"I suppose we are in some danger?\" said Miss Mebbin.\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she was unwilling to perform a bit more service than she had been paid for.\n\"It's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\" said Mrs. Packletide.\nTheir conversation was cut short by the appearance of the old tiger. He saw the goat, and lay on the earth for a short rest before attacking.\nThe gun fired very loudly, and the great yellow beast jumped to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited villagers appeared on the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village.\nIt was Miss Mebbin who found that the goat was dying from a bullet-wound, while no wound could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the tiger had died of heart-failure, caused by the sudden loud noise of the gun. Mrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery; but anyway, she owned a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly accepted the fiction that she had shot the tiger. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light heart, and her pictures appeared on the newspapers of England and America. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at a newspaper for weeks, and was in a depressed emotion for quite some time.\nMrs. Packletide's tiger-skin was inspected and admired by the neighbors, and Mrs. Packletide went to the Costume Ball in the character of Diana  .\n\"How amused everyone would be if they knew what really happened,\" said Miss Mebbin a few days after the ball.\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\n\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\" said Miss Mebbin, with her unpleasant laugh.\n\"No one would believe it,\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color1 rapidly.\n\"Loona Bimberton would,\" said Miss Mebbin.\nMrs. Packletide's face settled on greenish white. \"You surely wouldn't give me away?\" she asked.\n\"I've seen a weekend cottage near Dorking,\" said Miss Mebbin, \"six hundred and eighty. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\"\nMiss Mebbin possessed the pretty weekend cottage. Mrs. Packletide lost interest in animal-hunting.\n\"The extra expenses are so heavy,\" she said to inquiring friends. \n Question: What did Mrs. Packletide want the villagers to arrange for her? \n Options: (A) A platform in a tree (B)  A paid companion.

Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.\nWhile household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market.

Her husband's friend Richards was there, too. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of \"killed.\" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and hurried to send the sad message.\nShe did not hear the story as many women have heard the same. She wept at once, with wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone.\nThere stood, facing the open window, a comfortable armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul.\nShe could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver   with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves .\nThere was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? It was too hard to name. But she felt it, coming out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the smells, the color that filled the air.\nNow her chest rose and fell violently. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips. She said it over and over under the breath: \"free, free, free!\"\nShe did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, gentle hands folded in death; the face that had never looked at her except with love, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.\nThere would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers.\nAnd yet she had loved him--sometimes. What did it matter! What could love count for in the face of her realization.\n\"Free!

I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill.\"\n\"Go away. I am not making myself ill.\"\nHer fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her, all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long.\nShe arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister's begging. She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory. She held her sister's waist, and together they walked down the stairs.\nSomeone was opening the front door with a key. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's sharp cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.\nWhen the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills. \n Question: What really killed Mrs. Mallard? \n Options: (A) The joy of seeing her husband coming back alive.

Fashion goes beyond just clothes, though. It's important for some people to wear only the latest fashions and styles. For others, though, keeping up with trends isn't that important. The one thing that stays the same with fashion is this: it always changes!\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Hippies made bell--bottomed blue jeans popular. Also, in the 1980s, Michael Jackson made parachute pants all the fashion. Now try to find these items in today's clothing stores!\nDo you know why fashions change?The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change. Over time, the new replaces the old. People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music. We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles. When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate  their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate. In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.\nClothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years. Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to make themselves different from others.\nUnfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others. Don't forget that it's always OK to develop your own sense of style that is unique and separate from what the fashion world determines! Stay true to yourself and let your personality -- not your clothes -- speak for who you are! \n Question: What causes the changes of fashions? \n Options: (A) Advertisements change rapidly. (B)  Popular culture influences people. (C)  Movie stars are changing over time. (D)  New films and shows replace the old.",

It's these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals' ability to connect,\" says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University.\n\"But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage,\" Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:\nShy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.\nShy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation. \n Question: The passage mentions the study by Southern Illinois University just to show that  _  . \n Options: (A) shy people use rich facial expressions (B)  shy people are good at observing others (C)  shyness can be used to reduce anxiety (D)  shyness can be used in social connections",

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing.\nOliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth. One was an old woman, who was nearly always drunk, and the other was a busy local doctor, who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival.  _ \nHowever, Oliver managed to draw his first breath, and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly. His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered, \"Let me see the child, and die.\"\nThe doctor turned away from the fire, where he had been warming his hands. \"You must not talk about dying yet,\" he said to her kindly. He gave her the child to hold. Lovingly, she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips, then stared wildly around the room, fell back--and died. \"Poor dear!\" said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.\nThe doctor began to put on his coat. \"The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties,\" he said. \"If so, give it a little milk to keep it quiet.\" Then he looked at the dead woman. \"The mother was a good-looking girl. Where did she come from?\"\n\"She was brought here last night,\" replied the old woman. \"She was found lying in the street. She'd walked some distance, judging by her shoes, which were worn to pieces. Where she came from, where she was going to, or what her name was, nobody knows.\"\nThe doctor lifted the girl's left hand. \"The old story,\" he said sadly, shaking his head. \"No wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night.\"\nAnd so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse. Without clothes, under his first blanket, he could have been the child of a king or a beggar. But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes, yellow with age, he looked exactly what he was--an orphan in a workhouse, ready for a life of misery, hunger, and neglect.\nOliver cried loudly. If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan, perhaps he would have cried even more loudly.\nThere was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse, so Oliver was sent to a special \"baby farm\" nearby. There, he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing. Mrs Mann, the old woman who \"looked after\" them, was very experienced. She knew what was good for children, and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health. She also knew what was good for herself, so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food. The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children, but they always sent the beadle, a kind of local policeman, to announce their visit the day before. So whenever the board arrived, of course, the children were always neat and clean.\nThis was the way Oliver was brought up. Consequently, at the age of nine he was a pale, thin child and short for his age. But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann, his spirit was strong, which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all.\nOn Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the beadle, came to the house to see Mrs Mann. Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate, and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her.\n\"Quick! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed!\" she said. Then she ran out to unlock the gate which was always kept locked. \n Question: According to the passage, a workhouse was where   _  . \n Options: (A) many women died unexpectedly (B)  workers helped each other (C)  the poor and homeless lived (D)  people were only interested in money",

If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.\nStepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path. \n Question: If you believe that you \"have a good shot at improvement\", you believe that   _  . \n Options: (A) you are good at improving (B)  you are fond of improving (C)  you have a strong ability to improve (D)  you have a good chance to improve",

That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students. \n Question: Which is an initiative adopted by Crow at Arizona State University? \n Options: (A) Restructuring the teachers College. (B)  Launching the School of Life Sciences. (C)  Ignoring the linkages between disciplines. (D)  Enrolling more students from poor families.",

Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much! \n Question: What is the main topic of the reading? \n Options: (A) Famous stars in Bollywood.

Once a woman accepted the ring she became the \"property\" of the person who gave it to her and she was in a sense \"his.\" The first wedding ring could have been made of braided grass or hay (which would have been changed often), ivory, bone, or leather.  Eventually, metal was used, but the first wedding bands werecrude  and rough. However, the sentiment  remained the same-eternal commitment and love.\nThe Egyptians wore the wedding ring on the left hand because it was believed that a vein  in the left hand went straight to the heart. This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.\nIt is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.\nOnce you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels.

A sixtysomething couple needed to cut back on Christmas gifts to their children but weren't sure how to tell them about it. People who had been laid off wondered how to notify friends, respond to inquiries about their job search, and compete with former colleagues for positions.\nIf you are searching for the answers to them, write to me--an advice columnist. \n Question: What would you be expected to do if you were invited to spend a weekend with some Cape Cod homeowners? \n Options: (A) Ask someone for advice. (B)  Get your food and water ready. (C)  Bring a bottle of wine with you. (D)  Make a financial contribution to the cost.",

They appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives  . So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house. In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn   .\nHere is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the 1920s. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee's knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!\nIf your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet  . If  someone asks you a personal question, you might say \"that is none of your beeswax\". This means none of your business.\nSpeaking of personal questions, there is an expression when their children ask, \"Where do babies come from?\" Parents who discuss sex and reproduction   say this is talking about the birds and bees.\nButterflies are beautiful insects, but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach. That means to be nervous about having to do something, like speaking in front of a crowd. You would also not want to have ants in your trousers. That is, to be unable to sit still. \n Question: When you have butterflies in your stomach, you   _   . \n Options: (A) are too sick to sit still (B)  have ants in your trousers (C)  are nervous about something (D)  have a stomachache",

The effect of their grandparents' involvement was stronger compared to children from two biological parent families.\"\nThe study did not look at children who lived solely with their grandparents, though.\nThe findings have great implications for people in the United States, the authors said, because American grandparents are increasingly sharing living space with their grandchildren.

The Quad is located right in the heart of Greenwich Village, perhaps the most charming and interesting neighborhood in the city. Here are some attractions we recommend, all within a comfortable walk from the Quad:\nWashington Square\nAs one of the best-known of New York City's 1,900 public parks, it is a landmark in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village, as well as a meeting place and center for cultural activity. Come on a Sunday when it's most lively and festive.\nNew York University\nIt surrounds Washington Square. See the impressive Bobst Library and visit the amazing bookstore. NYU is now considered one of the most powerful universities in the world.\nJudson Memorial Church\nLocated on Washington Square south between Thompson Street and Sullivan Street, opposite Washington Square Park, this beautiful church was completed in 1892. The Judson is most famous for its vocal participation in social events.\nWashington Mews\nIt is a hidden, private street in New York City between Fifth Avenue and University Place just north of Washington Square Park. It was first developed as a mews (row of stables) that serviced horses from homes in the area. Since the 1950s the former stables have served as housing, offices and other facilities for New York University.\nJefferson Market Courthouse\nBuilt in 1833 as a market, it was later changed to a courthouse, and in the 1950s it was emptied and close to being destroyed. It was saved and turned into a library. Many consider it to be the most beautiful building in the village. \n Question: What does the author want to tell in the passage? \n Options: (A) To introduce some attractions in the Quad. (B)  To suggest the Quad Cinema is the best place. (C)  To imply the Quad attracts a lot of visitors. (D)  To tell readers to enjoy their life fully.",

Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.\nWhat, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome. \n Question: The passage is mainly about  _  . \n Options: (A) the importance of tourism (B)  different foreign cultures (C)  how to plan an overseas trip (D)  why people travel to foreign countries",

People travel here from many countries for their vacations. We have beautiful beaches, hotels, restaurants, shopping and sports.\nHowever, in my beautiful hometown, there are also very poor neighborhoods. These areas are crowded and have a lot of crime. Life is terrible for many of the children in these areas. Some don't really have a childhood because they're homeless and live on the streets. They don't have education. They don't have enough food. Many use drugs or have diseases or mental problems.\nLast year, I came back to Puerto Vallarta from my university in Mexico City. I spent one year as a volunteer with an organization called Outreach International. They have several programs. I volunteered for one program to help street children.\nI worked in a home for street children (all boys, at this one). At this home, the boys have a place to sleep and three meals daily. The home keeps the boys off the streets. It shows them another way of life. As a volunteer, I helped to prepare meals. I taught games---such as basketball, football and art. I helped the kids with their homework. These kids can be fun. They have a lot of energy, but they're also really tough. Their hardships on the streets make them strong and not always \"sweet little children.\"\nAt this boys' home, I met two other volunteers---Brian from Canada and Greg from Australia. In many ways, we were very similar. We were the same age, came from good homes and had a good education. They were both college students, like me. We became very good friends.

I suggested she experiment by not making her bed for two weeks. She was shocked, probably thinking I'd been raised by wolves in a forest. However, she went along with my idea.\nTwo weeks later she went into my office beaming. She had left her bed unmade for the first time in 42 years-and nothing bad had happened. \"And you know what?\" she said. \"I don't dry my dishes anymore, either.\"\nThis woman had made two major breakthroughs  . One was discovering that she had choices in her life that she had never seen before. The other was giving herself permission to be less that perfect. This story shows an important principle   about managing time: No one can do it all. Each of us has to make choices and accept trade - offs. The problem is, many people choose in ways that put themselves and their health last. They take better care of their houses and cars than they do of themselves. They put everyone else's needs ahead of their own.\nSo what is the solution? There's an easy way. Decide what you want in your life, and put that first. On a daily basis, that should include regular meals, enough sleep and time with your family. Exercise, leisure, friendships and hobbies should also be regular aspects of life. The point is to do something for yourself every day. The choice is yours: whatever makes you feel good about yourself and your life. Take a nap. Take a walk. Take time to play the piano.

Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.\nWhile household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.\nThe Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn't just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.\nSocial robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.\nFellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market. The company's \"Oshbot\" robot is built to assist customers in a store, which can help the customers find items and help guide them to the product's location in the store. It can also speak different languages and make recommendations for different items based on what the customer is shopping for.\nThe more interaction the robot has with humans, the more it learns. But Oshbot, like other social robots, is not intended to replace workers, but to work alongside other employees. \"We have technologies to train social robots to do things not for us, but with us,\" said Breazeal. \n Question: What can Oshbot work as? \n Options: (A) A language teacher. (B)  A tour guide. (C)  A shop assistant. (D)  A private nurse.",

Loosely themed around the Jules Verne book, Around the World in Eighty Days, the park was founded by Hunt Midwest Company. In 1982, Hunt Midwest bought a nearby waterpark, Oceans of Fun. In 2013, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun were combined to a one-ticket admission, providing all guests with access to  235 acres of amusement and water rides.\nHours: Worlds of Fun is open from April through Halloween.\nTickets: Buy and print online. Always try to buy your tickets in advance, to save time when you get to the park.\nReservations: World of Fun sells \" Fast Lane\" cards that save rides' time by allowing them to avoid the majority of wait for most of rides and attractions including Mamba, Plowler, and Patriot. Ride as many times as you want all day long.\nStrategy : Most visitors tend to  begin in the day with Prowler, the hottest attraction in the park. Use that tendency to your advantage and head to the Patriot first. After that, try the Dragons. Then work your way back to the Prowler. After riding the Prowler, there is only one roller coaster, Mamba. Hit it next. If the park is not very crowded, you can ride Boomerang on the way to Mamba. After riding Mamba, head back for a ride on the Wolf. By then you will have tried most of the popular rides and attractions in the shortest possible time.\nNews: In 2014, Worlds of Fun is adding Steel Hawk, a ride that will take guests up 301 feet in the air and spin them at a 45-degree angle for a 60-second flight. Wait to have a try. \n Question: When did Hunt Midwest's two parks start to share one ticket? \n Options: (A) In 1973 (B)  In 1982 (C)  In 2014 (D)  In 2013",

            "input": "Article: Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out. \n Question: Why did people throw Mary into the river? \n Options: (A) To take her life. (B)  To tell if she was a witch (C)  To test her swimming skills. (D)  To prove that she was guilty",

So after buying your ticket, go straight to it, where you'll be given a pair of glasses. About 160 visitors will pass through the 4D cinema every 8 minutes so don't worry about waiting time.

I had good days and bad days I didn't understand.\nChuquicamata, my host community, is a mining camp. When I arrived there, I was scared. It was so different from what I was used to. There were lots of dogs in the streets, and there was no downtown, few smoothly paved streets, and little to do for entertainment. Rain was not seen very often, earthquakes and windstorms were frequent.\nI had studied Spanish for two and a half years and was always one of the best students in my class. But in my first week in Chile I was only able to communicate and needed one person to whom I could explain my shock. I couldn't speak the thoughts in my head and there were so many.\nMost exchange students experienced this like me. Culture shock presents itself in everything from increased aggression towards the people to lack of appetite . I was required to overcome all difficulties.\nAs time passed, everything changed.

And I took math, physics, chemistry, biology, Spanish, art, and philosophy.\nBut the sacrifices were nothing compared to the gain. I learned how to accept and to succeed in another culture. I now have a deeper understanding of both myself and others. \n Question: On arriving in Chile, why did the author feel frightened? \n Options: (A) Because he did not know how to get along with the local people.

Apparently, rumours said that the 58-year-old actor took his life after a producer dropped him from Johnny English 3. Later, it was found that both the news were fake. Such rumours have their origins in social platforms, where it is not easy to track who made them.\nTrishneet Arora, ethical hacker from the city, said: \"Culprits are aware that Facebook does not store data on its servers, so the chances of getting tracked are less with such platforms.

On platforms like Facebook, one should resist clicking on any links, because it can pass on your login and password details to the hackers. Besides, one should forward news links only after checking out from reputed news websites.\"\nSo, if you click on his so-called \"suicide video\", you could unwittingly install malware in your system through which the hacker can access your personal details like logins and passwords.\nAnkit Aggarwal, a resident of Tagore Nagar, said: \"I have also been a great fan of actor Rowan Atkinson, so the news of his death was quite shocking for me.

A silence in a conversation may also show stubbornness, or worry. Silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable; therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap with conversation. Persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding a person's needs. &\nMany Native Americans value silence and feel it is a basic part of communicating among people, just as some traditional Chinese and Thai persons do. Therefore, when a person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops, what maybe implied  is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing. In these cultures, silence is a call for reflection.\nOther cultures may use silence in other ways, particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power. For example, Russian, French, and Spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion. However, Mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by a person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her. In still another use, persons in Asian cultures may view silence as a sign of respect, particularly to an elder or a person in authority.\nNurses and other care-geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing. Nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that a patient's silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily. A nurse who understands the healing  value of silence can use this understanding to assist in the care of patients from their own and from other cultures. \n Question: What may be the best title for the text? \n Options: (A) Sound and Silence (B)  What It Means to Be Silent (C)  Silence to Native Americans (D)  Speech Is Silver; Silence Is Gold",

When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.\nFor example , some might say, \"I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! \"\nThis guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!\nHe didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.\nSome politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, \" During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !\" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , \"During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. \"\nAdvertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, \"Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache.\" It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.\nThis kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well. \n Question: How many examples does the writer give to show how the truth is used to deceive? \n Options: (A) one (B)  Two (C)  Three (D)  Four",

It was in that moment that I felt a deep tension.\nI realized that even though I had married a man who I absolutely loved and adored, I really didn't have a clear sense of how he handled money and how the two of us were going to combine our different approaches to handling money in our marriage. I was more organized and detailed, but he was more of a _ type. I knew that getting on the same financial page was a key factor in creating a successful marriage and financial future.\nI asked my husband if he would be willing to set up a time each week to talk about our finances and develop a plan for getting rid of our credit card debt. My husband said he would be willing to do this. Admittedly, he was skeptical -- but willing.\nWe came to refer to our weekly meetings as our Financial Dates. We didn't really have a clue as to what we were doing. All we knew was that we needed to give our finances serious attention. Some Dates were filled with tense conversations. Other Dates were filled with laughter, joy and creativity. However, we kept showing up for our Dates and we never gave up.

Something shifted within us.\nInstead of our finances becoming a source of divisive tension that pulled us apart, they became\nthe glue that held us together as we became a unified team.\nI still recall the day that we excitedly crossed off our last credit card payment on the chart we had created.

We had been given wings to fly.\nNow, whenever I feel huge stress I ask myself, \"How am I contributing to what is happening right now?\" This gives me the ultimate power to take action.

They go shopping all day and go dancing all night. Or maybe they go sightseeing to places such as Disneyland, the Tai Mahal or the Louvre.\nSome people are bored with sightseeing trips. They don't want to be \"tourists\". They want to have an adventure-- a surprising and exciting trip. They want to learn something and maybe help people too. How can they do this? Some travel companies and environmental groups are planning special adventures. Sometimes these trips are difficult and full of the world. Some volunteers spend two weeks and study the environment. Others work with animals. Others learn about people of the past.\nWould you like an adventure in the Far North? A team of volunteers is leaving from Murmansk, Russia. The leader of this trip is a professor from Alaska. He's worried about chemicals from factories. He and the volunteers will study this pollution in the environment. If you like exercise and cold weather, this is a good trip for you. Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day. -\nDo you enjoy ocean animals? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii.

When children are little we make them read aloud, before the teacher and other children, so that we can be sure they \"know\" all the words they are reading. This means that when they don't know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone. After having taught fifth-grade classes for four years, I decided to try at all costs to rid them of their fear and dislike of books, and to get them to read oftener and more adventurously.\nOne day soon after school had started, I said to them, \"Now I'm going to say something about reading that you have probably never heard a teacher say before. I would like you to read a lot of  books this year, but I want you to read them only for pleasure. I am not going to ask you questions to find out whether you understand the books or not. If you understand enough of a book to enjoy it and want to go on reading it, that's enough for me. Also I'm not going to ask you what words mean. \"\nThe children sat stunned and silent. Was this a teacher talking? One girl, who had just come to us from a school where she had had a very hard time, looked at me steadily for a long time after I had finished. Then, still looking at me, she said slowly and seriously, Mr Holt, do you really mean that?\" I said just as seriously, \"I mean every word of it.\nDuring the spring she really astonished me. One day, she was reading at her desk, From a glimpse of the illustrations I thought I knew what the book was. I said to myself, \"It can't be,\" and went to take a closer look. Sure enough, she was reading Moby Dick , in edition with woodcuts. I said, \"Don't you find parts of it rather heavy going?\" She answered, Oh, sure, but I just skip over those parts and go on to the next good part. \"\nThis is exactly what reading should be and in school so seldom is, an exciting, joyous adventure. Find something, dive into it, take the good parts, skip the bad parts, get what you can out of it, go on to something else.

During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire. \n Question: What information can you find on the milestones? \n Options: (A) The builders of the road. (B)  The materials used in building roads. (C)  The distance from one city. (D)  The time spent in building roads.",

Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students. \n Question: Who will responsible for the gap between school English and real English? \n Options: (A) Their parents (B)  The students (C)  The school (D)  The education sys tem",

That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students. \n Question: Which is NOT part of the American dream most people share? \n Options: (A) People enjoy a quality life. (B)  People live longer and longer. (C)  The freedom to move around. (D)  An environment that is sustainable.",

But where will English be at the end of the 21stcentury?\nOne view is that English is going to become even more important as a global language, being most widely used in trade and media while some other languages will become less important or just disappear. Another view is that English is already breaking up into several separate languages. There are already dictionaries of the \"New Englishes\", such as Australian English, full of words that a British English speaker would not recognize.\nHopefully, neither of these things will happen. Although different varieties of English will continue to develop around the world, standard English will survive for international       communication. However, it is impossible for one language to totally control the world. Already, other languages are fighting back against the control of English on the net.

The Judson is most famous for its vocal participation in social events.\nWashington Mews\nIt is a hidden, private street in New York City between Fifth Avenue and University Place just north of Washington Square Park. It was first developed as a mews (row of stables) that serviced horses from homes in the area. Since the 1950s the former stables have served as housing, offices and other facilities for New York University.\nJefferson Market Courthouse\nBuilt in 1833 as a market, it was later changed to a courthouse, and in the 1950s it was emptied and close to being destroyed. It was saved and turned into a library. Many consider it to be the most beautiful building in the village. \n Question: Where is Judson Memorial Church? \n Options: (A) To the south of Washington Square. (B)  Behind Washington Square Park.

When it comes to taking selfies , knowing the following tips can directly affect the quality of your final product. .\nThe use of light is vital to improving image quality. Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast. Some apps offer useful filters, which can change your skin tone and eliminate pimples   on your face. \n Question: How can you find the angle that suits you most? \n Options: (A) Study your face at different angles.
