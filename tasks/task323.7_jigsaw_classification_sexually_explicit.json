The Gnostics thought that \"the flesh\" was evil; and the Stoics thought that anything as pleasurable as sex was to be avoided, but could be justified by saying it was for procreation. These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture. It is a wholly man-made concept, stemming from the thought that sex is nasty.\n\nRD trots out the standard traditionalist twaddle in support of this.",

All three have recanted or changed their stories at least once. Broaddrick and Willey testified, under oath, that Clinton never made unwanted advances. Witnesses, including Jones' own sister and BIL and six close friends of Willey's, stated that Willey and Jones had described their encounters with Clinton as consensual. Jones was exposed as a liar for saying Clinton's penis had a deformity, and Willey lied under oath repeatedly to Ken Starr's investigators.

Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality.

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years, according to a report released by his doctor.\nThe side effects of this drug are legion, and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

Mike and Jill had sex.  Jill was drunk: so Mike sexually assaulted her.\"  Well...Mike was drunk also...so couldn't it be that Jill assaulted him??  Why is it only one way.\n\nI've personally seen on the UAF campus a woman claim she was raped after she had sex with a male.  Multiple times even.  But the male student wasn't interested in dating, and after she realized this she was overheard saying she was \"raped\" for their sexual encounters.  How do situations like this play into that \"1 in 9\"?  Just curious as there are some serious lines that could be blurred in some of the answers.",

Just in the last 20 years well over a hundred GOP elected officials have been caught committing sex crimes. Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing. Nobody is pretending there is less sex on the left -but leftists don't try to legislate anything beyond 'consensual adults'. There's no hypocrisy in being gay or divorced on the left. There damn well is if you claim to support 'family values'.",

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

There is a big difference. A VPSO goes through state training & is recognized & supervised & paid by the state. There are way more VPOs than VPSOs. VPOs get a lot less training, & none of it is from the state that I know of. VPOs get lower pay, & VPOs are not officially recognized by the state due to the state's  opposition to tribal sovereignty. VPOs are paid & supervised by tribal councils. VPOs have high turnover & are often very young guys. VPSOs are meant to be a career option & have longer term professionals, generally. Both jobs are very tough & involve putting yourself in danger without a gun. High stress & low pay. Lots of alcohol-fueled domestic disputes, sometimes relatives. \n\nAnd to #3, yes the booze came from Bethel, the only hub here.

Don't worry, I'm not a perv, I just find them interesting.\" \n\nThat is what you sound like. \n\nNobody is saying a nurse is a perv for touching patients when they need to for their jobs. The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire. The article is not, \"Nurses open body bag to examine strange growths on a patient's genitals\" or something along those lines. This is not a case of medical intrigue, what it is, is a case of nurses using their position to take advantage of a patient - dead or alive. Curiosity is not an excuse. \n\nAlso, I would rather that patients feel safe enough to seek medical care for themselves and their children rather than fearing deportation for simply going to a doctor. I value human life more than I am concerned about illegal immigration.",

More important is the fact that before the Irish Sin Books were introduced, fewer things were considered mortal sin. Indeed, the concept of going to confession for them and saying a few prayers to have them removed was a development, as was the fetishization of being in a state of grace for Communion. That does not happen now either and it is a welcome change. No fetish is healthy. In a few decades, no one will remember the Church of the Holy Fetish.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.  The fact that some putatively pro-life and pro-family voters have glommed on to him demeans and disgraces those causes, and the fact that some members of the Catholic clergy are giving cover to vote for him is a lasting stain on the church.",

Yeah, he had a criminal record that wasnt very good but HE'S NOT A RAPIST AT ALL!!! Actually he is one of the best people i have ever met, he was the only one who protected me from my extremly abusive boyfriend. \n     Joshua Wesley Sherman is my BEST FRIEND. Yeah, his record is bad also but the Lane County Legal system is cruel and unusual. Most everything they claim he did wasnt true. They just pinned him guilty by making it his only option.\n  They tell you the details they want to but they arent telling you EVERY DETAIL. Joshua wasnt present when the crime was commited he has an alibi but they silenced her. If the TRUTH came out maybe it wouldnt go unnoticed when the police do faulty ass shit.",

When I got to her home, she was accompanied by a local Rape Relief representative.  As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

Bosco's has a 14 year old mow his grass and would get his grass in trouble and fined.   I employ over 100 people and years ago quit hiring kids under 18 because of the exact same crap that hit Bosco.

(she was working with her mother).  We were threatened with a $10,000 fine but it was waived but if it ever happened again, whammo.  An angry parent makes a call because they feel bad for their kid and this happens.  If you worry that much, don't let your kid work.",

If taxes go down, presumably competitiveness goes up (at the expense of social benefit recipients, of course), and if competitiveness goes up, then that pressures our programs.  I think at this point, the best thing we can do is continue to pursue opportunities on the EurAsian continent and continue reducing the amount of trade we do with the US.\n\nThe other thing I think Trump needs to address is wages, as they exist today, not only in the US, but, by extension, Canada and every other trading partner. The fact is that even though productivity has increased 100% in the last 30 years, wages have decreased by 10% and benefits by a lot more, in some cases, benefits have been totally smashed.

Even with such a steep and catastrophic recession progress still staggered on and it was very evident to my fresh eyes on the matter.

This is good business and good news. The people taking large financial risks employ the rest of us. It is a fact. That they can and do make it honestly should be applauded. It isn't some kind of easy street. A recession where there is some winning and more losing going on is especially difficult.\nOf course I know nothing about how Mr. Turner got ahead. The successful ones are smart enough and hardworking enough to do it honestly. If that bunch can't make it we are a failing political system.

The largely irrelevant question is whether that impeachment will be hyped up political maneuvering, or for cause.  Given the void where any sense of ethical or moral compass should be in both the Clinton's, it's probably a 50/50 toss up at best.  (For those fearing the Trumpocalypse, however, also do not fear -- if he's elected and starts going off the cliff he looks poised to try to take us over, Republicans are probably happy at the prospect of impeaching him as well to get the party back under their control and get a noxious puppet like Pence in office, who, to be fair, seems just normal level repugnant rather than the towering, lofty heights of disgusting HRC and Trump aspire to.)",

It was my opinion before this season that the Rockies had a two to three year window to win before they start to bleed young talent. That is still true. If they don't get off to a fast start next season they should trade Arenado while a team acquiring him would still have him under their control for nearly two seasons. Clean out the farm system of a team like the Yankees, Dodgers or Red Sox. I stated repeatedly last winter that the Rocks should trade Cargo while they could, both to free up the $20 million he is getting paid and to acquire young talent. There are two ways to win in baseball the way it is structured these days - you spend obscene money or you constantly stockpile your farm system. In the latter system you have to make tough decisions that mean trading bright young stars. Hopefully you swap a current All-Star for three future stars.",

I'm surprised that nobody on Canada's part thought about this loophole when negotiating the agreement with the Americans. It's not as though it couldn't have been anticipated. The only feasible approach now might be to change our laws to deny permanent status to anybody who illegally enters Canada after being denied refugee status or abandoning a refugee claim in a safe third country.

And, in truth, we already have a multitude of those who could be ordained.  If we \"inquired among the people of God\" thousands of good women and men \"would be found worthy\" to serve the community as priests.  See my \"Some of the Best Priests I Know are Women\" in U.S. Catholic, April 1993, vol 58 #4, P.30.  The reality is we are not ordaining women.  We are also not ordaining many men.

I explained to her that in the 'olden-days' people who went off to university to become educated were supposed to go into it with a broad focus and an open mind.  A Liberal Arts program used to be one of the hardest to enter and finish because the everyone was expected to study philosophy, languages, history, AND science and math.  Basically any educated person was expected to be well grounded in each of these areas.  Only after this did you go off to study your specialty.\n\nNow people in STEM programs are still are required to study outside of their specialized fields with mandatory courses, but for some reason it is the Liberal Arts faculties that decided to water down their programs and take out all of the 'hard bits'.  What good is a teacher, lawyer, or a diplomat who is illiterate in STEM (all that they have nowadays are the 'soft skills').",

This is a fabrication but helps builds the case for more military might in Eastern Europe.\n\nSecond -she traces the decline of US leadership to Donald Trump. Any academic worth his salt would know that  that decline preceded Trump by a wide margin. Bush's violation of international law and invasion of Iraq based on a  lie was the most egregious but Obama was there too with his war on Libya, Yemen, Pakistan and Syria  (covertly using drones).\n\nThird - the Libs are spending more on defence. Exactly what Trump asked Canada and its allies to do. Canada will likely be buying US weapons for the most part- sounds like a win for Trump,.\n\nFourth - Canada has no hope of bringing the ICC back to life and is unlikely to support a two state state solution  because of its silent support for Israel-the pariah state.",

We can blame the test, we can blame the curriculum, and we can blame the teachers; however; the education is out there to be had. The students who really want it and go after it do well. There are a great number of parents who see nothing wrong with the quality of education and they have raised the students to prove it. Too many excuses are afforded for failure. Teachers are not being turned out in the volume to meet the demands for a blame oriented structure called our educational system. Students are behind and are not at grade level and there are schools of thought that de-emphasize homework. Really, how badly do we want an education?",

In many ways Obamacare was modeled similar to the Dutch system whereas ours is modeled off the British system.  We use the Beveridge system which is funded through general taxation whereas Germany uses the Bismarckian system which is funded through social insurance.

This is interesting, but unrealistic. Canada's per capita drug cost is the third highest in the world after the US and Japan. I think we'd want to see government management achieve much more before we give them this massive and crucial responsibility. \n\nWhile I know we need universal drug insurance, this list is only a beginning. It won't solve access to high-cost specialty drugs that routinely cost tens of thousands of dollars a year. It can't answer for decades of government indifference. And it ignores the social insurance model that is very successful in Europe. But at least it keeps the discussion going, and maybe some day governments will respond.",

I think that we need to halt the damage that is being done by the Pro-Life faction in putting their focus on elimination choice; that has always led to practices going underground, not extinguishing practices.

And, we play the Dodgers at home in the last series. What an exciting season! Really, you have to give it to Bud Black. He's been masterful with the pitchers. The position players are not too unchanged from last year, except for the addition of Desmond. While I'm not sure that their averages, etc. are better, they seem to be responding much better to pressure at bats. That's the mental part of the game. And that's what makes Baseball such a great game!",

Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law.\n2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada?\n3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the history of the \"white slave trade\".

The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)",

That's why courts have limited the effect of the doctrine.  \nInstead, the travel should be evaluated based on its ability to reduce terrorism in the U.S., as Trump says it will.  However, the addition of North Korea to the travel ban shows that the purpose of the travel ban is not to reduce terrorism.  North Korea is a closed country, and almost no North Koreans visit the U.S.  Those few are largely diplomats going to the U.N., and they are allowed under the travel ban.  There have been no terrorist incidents in the U.S. caused by North Korean immigrants.  \nApparently, Trump added North Korea to the travel ban to make it appear that it wasn't a Muslim ban.

So that civilians can flee to safety, you understand.\n\nI trust everyone can see the degree to which Western nations will sacrifice innocent civilians in countries that they target for regime change.

That was the only disappointment? The self-employed were only 15% of the employed in May. So if there was a relatively strong 0.25% increase in all jobs, there was a substantially weaker 0.15% growth in employee jobs. Self-employed jobs grew by 0.77% but these are mostly lower-paid and part-time jobs, and thence part of the lean to part-time jobs if you do a full-time part-time split. This is also part of the explanation for their being no increase in nominal average hourly earnings at all in June; so even though the job numbers were good, real wage growth continues to disappoint.",

NBA doesn't have an issue because basketball Olys are during summer Games, so why not hockey? Solves the issue of disrupting the schedule.

How black youth respond to authority and the excessive crime among young black males does pertain, in my opinion. Police use excessive force against all races, not just black people.

The poor sap working and paying taxes in Canada certainly hasn't seen a 35% increase in his or her wage?  Mr. Gordan makes a good point on taxes.  If you are not paying Canadian income taxes, you should be paying significantly higher property taxes for the services our taxes provide.  The one time tax for foreign investors, while a move in the right direction, does not go far enough.  The young people of our country deserve better.",

Much of what should be expected of a councilmember is to be an active member of the community and Byron Shutz is one of the best examples you can find.\n\nIn elective office there is one yardstick that should be used to evaluate candidates to get your vote and it isn't what they say, it's WHAT THEY DO.

Over the last 50 years, much of the U.S. has seen increases in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, heavy downpours, and in some regions, severe floods and droughts.\"\n\nhttp://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/extreme-weather",

If Canada can promise that every Canadian can be financially stable, and show some economic personal growth I truly believe most wouldn't resort to these measures.

Despite regular requests, Matthew Rainwater has refused to narrow the scope of his public records request.  Even though I have indicated to him that his request as it stands will take three years to fulfill, he has made it clear he expects me to fulfill it before I leave office.  From my perspective, Matthew Rainwater's public records request is yet another setup to get me sued, like the county did on behalf of the PDN's public records request last year.",

Expansions are part of the presidents discretion. this includes how much land and water to add. Most of FDRs uses of the Act were expansions to existing monuments. More recent presidents dont expand existing monuments as much, Obama has only expanded a monument 3 times.

Perhaps because they have no faith in government bonds, our currency in general, our pensions, etc. etc., because of the government's \"printing of money\" and not managing its debt. That's why people are socking money into real estate. It actually offers some return on investment.

Understandable mistake, don't you agree? To further understand the Mass we also, importantly, need the Easter Sunday miracle.  But I must add a note of disagreement with your statement (traditionalist as it is) of:\"...the priest is not \"representing\" Jesus but instead stands in His person, presenting His sacrifice to the Father for the people.\"  Vatican II was exceptionally clear that there is a second and equally vital part to that equation, and that is that the Presence of Christ occurs through the union of priest and congregation.

They understand that any nation that possesses the bomb is almost immune from being invaded and overthrown which is why they are\nso bent on developing their ability to put the bomb on a ballistic missile.\nAt the end of the day, the US and South Korea may have no option but to overthrow Kim Jong Un. It will be costly but the choice is to do it now or have to do it later.  If President Truman had listened to\nGeneral McArthur, we would not be facing this problem.",

Called me at work the next day to say he was returning my rental deposits.  Gave some bull$hit excuse.\n\nWe had a newborn at the time, and faced homelessness despite both working full-time because of a$$holes like Frumpy the Clown.",

And last but not least, if manufacturing a \"fiscal crisis\" by trying to make us believe we're out of money to justify stealing our PFD, essentially taxing every man, woman and child isn't enough proof for you, then my man, you've drank the koolaid and we can't help you.",
