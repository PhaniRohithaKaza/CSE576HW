My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming. I, also, wonder why it is  his business,  and  question the use of passive voice. \"Made to be our business.\" Indeed. Back in the closet with you all.",

Why hold one religion to a different set of standards than another?

Sometimes you just got to let things slide by instead of trying to control and judge everything that comes up because you can't fight every injustice that occurs. So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said \"Hey, can you do this for us?\" and the dude replied \"No.\"",

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on LGBT rights-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a \"homosexual lifestyle\".[1]\"  \n\nIMO, the \"real\" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as \"second-class\" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.

At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.  As Chief Justice Roger B. Taney said in the famous 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision about the Founding Fathers’ mindset in drafting the Constitution:\n\nBlacks had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.

This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.",

I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks.  They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game. Black folks gave Hillary well over 90% of their registered vote voters.",

It seems that a bunch of white people who don't have friends from other religions or cultures are quick to jump on the perceived \"politically correct\" bandwagon without understanding what the niqab represents. (Reminds me of the stupid naive white non-Muslim Ontario politician that once said we should allow Muslim immigrants to practice sharia law in Canada if they want.)

After looking at both their twitter feeds two things stand out. Anger at anything white and the lack of a male role model in childhood. Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader.",

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

There is also offense taken if you insist on ALL lives matter.   Tell me again about racism.   Blacks can exclude whites or any other group from their gatherings, but let whites try to exclude blacks from a gathering and cries of racism  ring out from coast to coast.  Tell me again about racism.  Blacks can riot and yell racist chants, but nary a word is said.  Let all blacks be nominated for an award and it is cheered as diversity, let the same group nominate all whites and it is racist.

Islam is very conservative while Islam leaders of Canada associate themselves with leftist and liberals. The latest know very well what Islam stands for but they need votes. This is why they want Muslims as \"allies\". Otherwise they fear the stand of Islam towards life, gay marriage etc and reject Islam. Of course conservatives will not support Muslims as they are on the other side of the fence therefore, Muslims they have no real friends in right or left. If Muslim leaders try to associate themselves with those who in most part agree with them (in abortion, traditional family values etc) they will have more real allies and solve Islamo-phobia issues.

Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.\n\nOn the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.",

By this definition, what the anti-rights fanatics want is most definitely NOT compromise. We compromised in 1934. We compromised again in 1968. We compromised again in 1986, which, per the agreement at the time, was supposed to be the LAST compromise. But it didn't stop there, now did it. We had more disarmament measures foisted upon us in 1989, and 1994, and they just keep trying for more. \n\nWe're done with your \"compromise\". We showed this by removing many of those who voted to disarm us in 1994, and the majority of Americans continue to demonstrate that attempting to disarm us is political suicide.",

For example, \"unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle\" law was originally intended to address car theft. For whatever reason, it then was the administrative states decision to use that same law to try someone who say, punches someone through a car window. Not enough evidence for an \"assault\" charge? No prob. \"Unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle\". Am I a purist? No. But pretty close. If judges are allowed to interpret the laws not by original intent nor by what is written, then why need legislators?  Isn't that abrogating the legislative branch?  You usually bring up separation of powers and co-equal branches, why not in this instance? If the judicial branch can override the legislative, then you also support overriding the executive which in the past you have commented about. Why have elections?",

The development of ethics and morals are primarily the responsible and role of parents & families. We cannot blame a school for what these individuals did and assume that all graduates of this school are \"rich and powerful\".  Yes, there are some very powerful and politically connected graduates.  Perhaps they can bring some public pressure to prosecute these individuals. Let's pray & have faith that the prosecutor's office is able to move forward, bring charges to these individuals and justice for these innocent animals. Mahalo to Denby for this article.",

Secondly, if you're going to throw political party affiliation into this then why don't you explain why the (D)onkey politicians haven't stopped the supposedly high homicide rates. Your buddy Obama was a complete backstabber to your own (D)onkey ideologies and gun ownership actually doubled under his presidency and therefore homicides went down. The Republicans are trying to increase the gun ownership rates further to continue to decrease the homicide rates but a bunch of bleeding heart soft liberals are screaming bloody murder to stop him while ignoring the record gun sales under Obama!

Clement of Rome pegged it for some time in November (Jesus was a Scorpio!) Hippolytus didn't have a particular date, but he was sure it was a Wednesday.  Shepherds would not have been in the field with their flocks in the middle of winter (it snows in Israel during the winter,) and pilgrims would not have made the trek to complete the supposed census in the harsh conditions of winter.  Some contemporary scholars suggest September, based on the supposed date of John's birth, etc.  Point is, Christmas is a bit of a historical mystery, but I guess that doesn't matter to those who want life time-warped back to the 1950's.

The op refers to the fact that it was traditionally published on the opposite page of the papers Editorials and Letters to the Editor.  In doing so, it is recognized that there are no clear lines between analysis and opinion.\n\nJust as I had the additional reading comprehension to recognize that when the author of the Op Ed writes \"Looking at coastal flood and storm-surge protection\" when starting a paragraph, he is talking about the Texas coast in general not Houston specifically. The paragraph break between land use planning and Houston and the clearly differentiated paragraph about the coastal area was another clue.

Wind comes and goes.  Without addressing the variability issue, proponents cannot be taken seriously.\n\nOf course hydropower, which is short term stable is an incredible, wonderful source of renewable energy.  It also is driven by the sun which evaporates water which is then dropped at high elevations allowing its energy on the way back to the see to be harvested.  We should have water wheels along the rivers and streams.  No flow blockage.  Reliable energy.\n\nSolar and wind can only play a major role if the variability problem is addressed.

That should mean that each school in the district should get $6,000 per pupil to educate the students. No one believes that will be enough and no one believes that voucher money will be for 100% of the required amount. So, if a family gets even $5,000 in voucher money, they will have to make up the rest and the private school will have to fund whatever else it takes to educate each pupil.

Contemporary study in the \"humanities\" holds that there is nothing called the \"human.\" The human is a kind of religious vestige, a universalist fantasy that is itself ideological and foisted on groups and inculcated in individuals, often to their disadvantage.The humanities now study the ways human animals are essentially different and divided from each other into various kinds of groups with power distributed asymmetrically among the groups. The arts and histories and even the sciences these groups produce either reproduce and strengthen these asymmetries or expose and oppose them.  And there is no \"truth\" or \"philosophy.\" There is only the sociology of knowledge. So the decline in the humanities is not a decline in enrollments to be addressed with better marketing. It is an outcome of the humanities themslves.",

Jesus called 12 Israelite males as apostles (no gentiles) to fulfill a blood promise to Abraham & fulfill the law & prophets.  Males represent lineage because they pass down their blood.

Can a person, while conscious, give advance consent to sexual activity while unconscious? The Supreme Court of Canada has answered that question in the negative, and by doing so has potentially opened a serious can of worms. Many people in established relationships enjoy being awakened by their partner's intimate touch; however, as it stands any such touch constitutes an assault. You may have been married and sleeping together for years while enjoying an active and varied sex life, but if you touch your sleeping bed partner for a sexual purpose you are committing sexual assault.

Low income workers are as well often over represented in prison, compared to those with skills and higher education. No one would really suggest that the crown went out and made up charges against blacks , serious enough that they would get a sentence in federal prison, as there would have to be a crime committed. The statistic could have reworded to read that the number of backs committing crimes increased between 2005 and 2015. Then what you would need to do is study the socio-economic factors of those committing the crimes to see if you can account for the rise.

Yes there are many dedicated bike lanes, but what stuck out more than anything was the respect drivers had for cyclists. Plus, people ride their bikes in Europe because its what they can afford. And the distances they cover are much less than what we cover in the GTA. \nIt drives me nuts when people compare Europe to Canada. Here in the GTA it's a mini war between pedestrians and cyclists and the car/truck. I've never felt that way in Europe. In fact it's the opposite. \nTo change attitudes for cyclists and the car will take another 25 years .",

Data presented in the article does nothing to scientifically support that this bias exists. We can be inspired to have hunches (and I am), but a real scientifically-driven exposure of injustice requires a measure of force actionable offenses as they relate to force actually delivered compared to race of force recipient, right?\n\nTo defend the data presented as proof of injustice is to assume that each race equally engages in force actionable offenses. Why should I assume this? I wouldn't be surprised if oppressed people (black Americans in this case) were proportionately more frustrated with their captors. Frustration begets violence among other outcomes, predictably...but why should a scientific perspective include a data-free prediction of each race behaving the same?",

It just may be that the big oil companies will make out if they buy out the small companies especially where fracking is involved and just sit on the oil until the prices go up.",

Sorry Justin - we're not buying your naive, elitist piffle.\n\nWe need to teach Canadian values -  the rights AND RESPONSIBILITIES of BEING a Canadian - the Charter of Rights and Freedoms - the obligations to our fellow citizens and hopefully......we need to teach these things at early ages and continue to instill those values.

Utility bills are paid with after-tax money, and so your investment also needs to be non-tax sheltered as well for an apples to apples. Sure, there's some risk around the Tesla warranty.  But it's relatively small.  Even if Tesla fails it doesn't mean that your roof will fail. \n\nAnother point that I neglected is that the bill savings can be reinvested.

More recently, however, there's been a shift as Canada has seen a growth in immigrants (and their offspring) from other religions, often from regions and/or communities where religion is synonymous with personal identity. One study, for instance, indicated that over 60 percent of Muslims in Canada identify primarily as Muslims rather than as Canadians. For many Canadians this is a troubling trend. As my now-deceased father used to note, the most positive social development he witnessed in his lifetime was the decline in sectarian religious chauvinism in the aftermath of WWII.

Trent and Vat I work for decent order, but reflect the RC fearful weakness in imposing uniformity.

Trump's comment that this is a \"ruse\" is far more credible than the paranoid, somewhat hysterical pronouncements on Russia one hears from a wide variety of U.S. cources every day.

Years ago I ran, triathlon trained,  with a woman who had successfully shed around 150 lbs and never dieted once.  She began by walking and just adding more activity started the weight loss.  As she shed a little weight she added weight training, then biking, swimming and running.

Today, most cobalt goes into consumer electronics:  over a billion cellphones, 500 million tablets, laptops, and PCs, and millions of cameras, power tools and other portable devices. But I see no faux outrage over that.\n\nAbout 120,000 tonnes of cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Less than a quarter from reprehensible \"artisanal\" mining.  In comparison, we consume 100,000,000 barrels per DAY of oil. Vehicle air pollution causes 53,000 premature deaths each year just in the U.S. alone. The extraction, transportation, refining and ultimate burning of gasoline and diesel has a human and environmental cost that is orders of magnitude greater than from electric vehicle batteries. \n\nRather than blame EVs, it would be more productive to add Cobalt to the list of \"conflict\" minerals and strengthen existing international sanctions.",

I would call any program which is designed to take from one group (wealthy) and give to another (poor), a welfare program.  Both medicare and SS do this.  It is important to point out that while the program is a welfare program, many who receive payments from it are net payers into the system, thus are actually supporting the system.  Others are net receivers from the system, draining it.  \n\nI make no judgment against those who are net receivers.

I want to tell you that the problem not in land or ethnicity, the problem is in religion. Arab Muslims do not want to tolerate people following Judaism as their neighbors. Many Jews are following Judaism in Israel. Now about settlements. Some settlements exist more than 20 years. They are now well developed cities with civic infrastructure, colleges, hospitals, universities and population from 60 to 200 thousand people. Those settlers revived soil on empty lands and planted gardens, vineyards, fields of vegetables, trees, built roads. Also they gave work for Arabs from Palestine on their small enterprises.

Obama Care, while suffering startup pains, and needing fixes, has generally been successful. Obama has been highly cautious and polite on race issues, but he is a moderate Democrat of Black heritage and proud of it. There has not been even the slightest hint of scandal in the very classy Obama family. Why all the anger and doom and gloom?",

And they are nothing more than coastal attack aircraft, not anything like we need.\n\nI think there is a clue in the article. As follows:\n\nIncreasing Canada’s fighter fleet to 120, up from less than 80 functional CF-18s today.\n\nNow, it would appear that if we plan on increasing our fighter fleet to 120, we won't be buying F-18's, we will be buying Swedish Gripens, which is just what we DO need. I would prefer Russian, but I doubt we could dance that one past NATO (if it still exists in 5 years).",

It assumes that mass transit does not depend on bridges and roads.\nI am glad the author lives  where rail/ air transportation are the bases of  mass transit and owning a car is a burden rather than a need.

Or do they just ask the person in the U.S. and a verbal answer is sufficient?  I wonder how someone would show that a person in the U.S. was their grandmother or grandfather and what documents they would need?

It is what this business amounts to. A stop order is not analogous to the way money is deducted here. Stop orders are issued on a specific day every month. Not the moment you receive payment. It is very possible to transfer or spend money before a stop order is issued so that there is risk of nonpayment. It is also possible for you to open another account even at another bank if you don't want to pay a stop order. SASSA grant recipients can't do any of this.

The Governor is doing the will of the voters and I was one of them. We told him to do the best he can in the time he has.  A gasline is important enough to our economic future to let that vetting and negotiating come to it`s logical conclusion. There are many facts we cannot know because of industry confidentiality and secrecy that`s built into the system in Alaska.  I think I heard we should know more at a mid-2017 checkpoint.. June or so.  I`m sure pulling for good news by then.",

My tenant approached me about voluntarily increasing his rent since he sees what extortionate rents are going for in this neighborhood and he's worried.   And I suppose it's tempting when instead of getting his $975 per month I could be getting $2400.  On the other hand, he's been a great tenant for 6 years and I feel I owe him my loyalty in return for his.  After all, we have to ask ourselves what kind of city we want to live in?
