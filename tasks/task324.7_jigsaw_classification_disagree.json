His supporters ignore the moral difference and buy into the false equivalence between the radical left and right, they see BLM and Antifa as repugnant as the KKK.  \n\nHe is stating a fact that some parties on both sides were looking for a fight.

In Vancouver, new listings actually DECREASED following the introduction of the tax. \n\nFurthermore, the Toronto tax is more robust, has fewer exemptions and is tied to Teranet rather than relying on self-reporting like the Vancouver tax. \n\nBut more importantly, what we are seeing in Toronto is a reaction in part to the Home Capital Group situation and the attendant increased borrowing costs/unavailability of credit for the riskiest borrowers in Toronto.",

Me thinks that UAA, with a potential fan base in a population of 400,000(Anc and Mat-su), would more appropriately belong in a Division I program.

The quote used is \"the size of these negative emotion sex differences is not very large.. ..accounting for less than 10% of the variance\".  That is, the difference between men and women is small.\n.\nYour tangent claims that whatever the ratio of influences between nature/nurture that the outcomes of peoples desires is the only measure to determine the makeup of a workplace.  This assumes that the \"nurture\" part of the equation is exactly the same for both men and women.  That is a fault assumption.  \n.\nSo to answer your question ... yes, sometimes a more gender equal workplace should be forced.

You could discourage them, dismiss them with lots of good counsel as to why they were being let go, but they just popped up somewhere else.

Given Manu's position with OHRC, as a man, I find this very frightening.  False allegations do happen.  My own instincts tell me the real cause of low conviction rates of sex assault cases is that they are hard to prove and Police forces can't spend time and resources on one word against another scenarios, without the prospect of a conviction.   Sex assault is heinous, but the way forward to more consistently bring  perpetrators to justice is not to risk false convictions. And the way forward is certainly not framing this as a Human rights issue.  .   \n\nI have to agree with some other contributors.   This series was not the Globe's finest work.",

The Lord himself did prescribe animal sacrifices but for God, not for his own nourishment. Either way, we are in a different time now. We don't, at least as Christians we don't, do animal sacrifices.

Will they mandate that all maps in schools must show the four corners of the Earth resting atop four pillars? \n\nSure can't vote NDP with the state of Ontario's finances the way they are. \n\nGreens?

I would evaluate the validity of his opinion on something other than whether or not he has credentials. I say this because there are persons who, without the benefit of degrees and credentials, have contributed significantly to our body of knowledge and philosophy.

To say you empathize implies that you get where the other person is coming from, you 'feel their pain'.  Come now, do you really?

My citizenship ceremony (40 years ago) was a virtual United Nations and I don't think that anybody knew or cared about anybody's religion or race.   \nOf course, she can play her card and continue to retain whatever chip on her shoulder she arrived here with, but it would be nice if she just moved on and if she realized that the only racist and religious bigot in the room is her. \nOn the other hand we can apologize to her like I seem to do for all my ancestors who did not live here.",

Islam was originally founded in a desert area by nomadic peoples, not the sedentary cultures of today.\n\nThe Koran encourages violence in many ways, like allowing men to beat their wives. It  encourages Muslims to stike out against non Muslims.  All very good 1500 years ago but maybe not today.

A C8 operates so on a 100-round drum or is fed by a disintegrating belt.\nThe lightest machine guns, like the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, are substantially heavier than an infantry weapon. They have rates of fire of 800 rounds per minute, while heavy (typically mounted) machine guns have a lower rate of fire.",

If you own a 5mm home, then presumably you have some income to cover that 60k per year maintenance and lifestyle spending. Perhaps 250k or so.   Downgrading in size to a 8k/mo apartment - likely 1/3 or less the sq ft of the home - is a big change.  Likely no stay overs for the grandkids anymore, etc. Also, at disposition, cap gains on home are tax free vs. 30+pc for investments.

This happened EVERY single time for over 20 years.

Words have become twisted:  killing babies in the womb is called ‘choice’ or ‘reproductive health’, any objective critique of sexual behaviour with reference to biology, psychiatry and ethics is called ‘homophobia’, and invitations to rational debate are dismissed as ‘bigotry’.\nMainstream Catholic colleges, like BC, NDame, and G’town, are Catholic in name only—they’re Catholic in the same way that Harvard is Congregationalist.   If these colleges really wanted to be a voice of clarity  in the wilderness, they would become an oasis of truth in a world where words have lost meaning and free speech is no longer even remembered.",

And the report indicates that vessel haul out, repair, and/or scrapping is an actual feasible use of the site. Yes, money would have to be spent, just like when any other business moves to a new location. The fact remains that if a business moved to the site, it would be saving about $80 million on a pre-built basin. That's hardly cost prohibitive, that's a steal. \n\nAll I'm saying is it's a waste to fill it in, and there are businesses and other uses that could be found for that site.

The safest thing we could do would be to withdraw all military forces from conflict areas and allow the relentless civil disorder burn itself out.  We don't seem to intervene without causing more death and destruction than if we had refrained.  When the locals achieve stability with whatever form of government they chose, we can win them over with trade and the enjoyments of modern western culture.

My wife TJ, who is a New Zealander,  and I wanted to give them an overseas experience to instill the 'travel bug' in their minds. We then discovered 'Homelink' by an internet travel search and found a number of interesting opportunities in England. After submitting photos of our house, we received a response from Shelley and Ian Salisbury of Oxford. Within a few weeks, and 2 emails, we had settled on a mutually agreeable 3 week exchange. On the agreed date, we flew to Oxford, picked up their car at the airport and drove to their home. Our 1st dinner  was already prepared. We had a great time touring England and even Paris in 3 weeks. I only write to urge you to mention \"homelink\" in any future article. Dave Russell",

In the country's better days, this would be seen as a grand challenge to develop an economy based around renewables, just like the challenge to reach the moon.

It would seem that both parties are responsible for that. Bush added $10 trillion to it and Obama will add about $10.6 trillion. The economy has not recovered because you can't improve an economy in the long-term with deficit spending. Just take a look at Japan and you can see that clearly. Deficit spending and debt are an anchor on the economy that gets heavier with every dollar.\n\nSo, does it matter if we elect either Hillary or Donald? No. If you look honestly at their platforms, they are essentially the same candidate. Hillary is open borders, anti-tariff and pro-war. Donald is strong immigration policy, high-tariff and appears to think war is not a good economic idea. In just about everything else, they are the same candidate. Go on ... go do some research.\n\nI'm not voting for either one of them, btw. Vote 3rd party!",

The lower rate on buildings makes them cheaper to construct, improve and maintain.  This is good for residents and for businesses.  Surprisingly, the higher rate on land helps keep land prices more affordable by reducing the profit from land speculation and thereby reducing the speculative demand for land.  \n\nFor more info, see \"Funding Infrastructure to Rebuild Equitable Green Prosperity\" at http://revitalizationnews.com/article/funding-infrastructure-for-sustainable-equitable-revitalization/",

On the plus side, he throws an incredible ball and has a command of the offense & teammates respect.  I do not think he is as accurate as some folks portray.  \n\nThere might have been no debate about the QB position if the outcome of two games were different last year.  The K.C. Chief game at home where Siemian led them to a winning score late in the 4th quarter, only to have the defense blow it.\n\nAnd, the Tennessee Titans road game where late in the four quarter on a potential game winning drive, he hit Bennie Fowler in the nose with a perfect pass that Fowler couldn't catch (bye Bennie, I've seen enough not to waste a roster spot on you.)",

It is not something that I would say, I think Benedict's experience as a scholar helped him as a pastor. But it seems to be what you are implying.\n\nI'm not sure why you would use the word incompetence about Francis -- he is at a pretty high level before reaching whatever it is you consider incompetency.

Theologians were arguing against the exegesis just as vigorously as legislators were arguing against legal racism. \n\nUnfortunately, re gay marriage, the theologians are lagging behind the legislators, and it is this sad fact that renders on-going gay discrimination in the name of religious conscience not exactly the same thing. \n\nThose of us who reject the religious arguments against gay marriage must be very careful, it seems to me, that we do not end up arguing that the law need not take religious conscience into account.

To label physical assault a more \"serious\" form of assault is odd - actually, it's absurd and undermines the horrific nature of sexual assault/harassment and domestic violence.

With Franklin Strait (charted by McClintock in 1859), James Ross Strait, and Rae Strait, it's part of what I called \"the crucial track east of King William Island.\" I used this shorthand because it was impossible to explain all the geographical details within my assigned word limit.\n\nMcGoogan doesn’t contest the point that Franklin might not have discovered Franklin Strait in 1846.

As for Ebes64, I cannot say. Whether one is gentle or not does not come through on posts. You can be Ace and still come across as a hetero doctrinaire bully online.

He told them it was official state business and he needed to get into the room. He later admitted that he had been sexually involved with her. This incident sparked multiple complaints of sexual harassment from various women around the capital. In 1994, the Senate officially censured Jacko, ending his political career, or so we thought. News about Jacko continued to fill newspaper columns and evening news spots. In 1997, Jacko was served with a protective order to stay away from a 16-year-old girl in Homer. Within two hours he was arrested for violating that order. Per the Empire, the mother of the 16-year-old claimed that Jacko was “obsessed” with her daughter. The two would often engage in long phone conversations, including one that lasted 10 hours. In 1998 he was convicted of violating the restraining order.”",

One such trip the count was over 100 hares that the bus got. \n\nMy first two winters after I graduated, I did a lot of hare hunting to add meat to the larder and the population was still quite high. Never tries snaring them. I always liked head shots with a .22. Never wasted any meat. Was easy to get 20 a day or more in those years.

It's not the typical fast food joint, it's not a big corporate gig, and it's far from town. It's small business, it's artistic, gives people a chance to live their dreams and also an job/income creator. Find a way to provide proper amenities, permits and parking, as I'd like to see more soul and less ego drive the economy.

This can lead to low weight preterm babies, cardiac disease, bone loss, diabetes, and dementia. Surely the costs to the medical system for admissions to hospitals and treatments clearly out-price the costs for routine dental care.\nAdditionally, a poor dentition causes pain, malnutrition due to a decreased ability to chew healthy foods.

The law was changed in 1986 to ban any new ones from coming on the market but the old ones were grandfathered. You can still buy one today under the NFA (if you can find a seller) but because the supply is limited they sell for thousands of dollars. According to the BATF there are currently 175,977 fully automatic legal machine guns in civilian hands and the only legal one I can find that was used in a crime since 1934 was by a police officer that killed an informant and it wasn't clear if the firearm was his or his department's.",

Time will tell.  \n\nMeanwhile, be careful: there are people who will take offence at anything, and will report it, too.",

The fish may be spreading them into the open ocean.  And the parasite is being ingested by marine mammals and killing them by the thousands from--at least--British Columbia to New Zealand and beyond.

Their responses were vague and indicated no concern about safety or anything else.\n\nMeanwhile, Toronto has a dozen sites where vulnerable facilities (the PPS calls them \"sensitive uses\") lie next to transmission pipelines. These \"uses\" include geriatric facilities, schools, a major transit hub, a hotel and several high-rises. The distance between the pipeline marker and the wall of the facility ranges from 10 feet to about 40 metres.\n\nAnyone who is familiar with the literature regarding pipeline releases of flammable fuels knows the suddenness and extreme risks that are presented by such events. Pressures in these pipelines are extreme, usually between 500 psi and 1440 psi, resulting in a geyser effect: fuel is sprayed into the air creating a highly flammable aerosol.",

Even when he was arguing for voluntary colonization during his first two years as president, Lincoln did not envision forced deportations of ex-slaves.

It is a top-down, not bottom-up party by the very fact that centralism promotes patronage.

The first:\n\n1)  There seems to be a view of the Eucharist proposed by some (including perhaps the present pope) that verges on magical thinking:  the notion that the Eucharist is some sort of spiritual vitamin that perks us up--the corollary being that if you don't receive Communion you run the risk of becoming spiritually malnourished.  So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.\n\nWhile we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.  An alternative is one in which the Eucharist encourages us to repent of our sins and reform our lives.  Instead of insisting that the Eucharist be supplied to us, we should move towards personal holiness and thus be bring ourselves closer to the sacrament.",

Grandparents had so much anger from their trauma that it migrated with them to these islands. That sentiment still seethes in parts of Asia.

Of course the real reason was simple hygiene, that comes with handling food no matter race.\nThis default playing of the race card (and yes it exists, just like black racists), is pushing people into the defensive.

That law requires certain sexual offenders who have served ALL their time to be placed on parole-type supervision for at least 15 calendar years minimum.  At the end of the 15 years the offender can petition the sentencing court to be released from supervision, but the court is under no duty to grant the petition.  If denied, an offender has to wait 3 years before renewing the petition.  Couldn't you see a judge repeatedly denying a petition until the offender dies of old age? My point is this:  in some states the offender is never even given the chance to show they are willing and determined to stay offense-free without all the intensive supervision and containment strategies.  That means their constitutional rights are diminished for life.  Parolees have lower rights than others.",

Wouldn't the far greater incidence of this make at least suicidal ideation more likely among them?\n\nMy own suspicion is that there are greater pressures (bullying, discrimination, ridicule, physical violence) on LGBT, not just because they are perceived as a sexual minority, but one that has been morally censured by various faith communities.\n\nI suspect that a higher percentage of the general population is LGBT (not the 3.2% suggested).

I cant stand Trump but the hypocrisy is stunning. The DNC according to their own emails ran cons to manipulate Trump into the candidacy through the use of the news media. The reason for this is their weak and very disliked candidate on both the left and right. Their tactic is to point at Trump and say look at the bad man so you can't see our awful candidate. It is clear the DNC also manipulated Sanders who was used as a sheepdog to herd in new voters who were supposed to be turned to HRC. That did not work out so well so now they are tacking right to pick up the anti-Trump Reps. We have two frightening candidates, I will not vote for either of them.",

It is important not to use superlatives like I did, however it is also not fair we compare sports, as that is slippery slope :) Are we cutting teams by who is least successful or teams that contribute the most to our state and community? You can see how someone will eventually throw one team under the bus, versus another based on performance and cost, where that is not the point, but a red herring in our discussion. My point, that I failed at adequately communicating was that just because a team does not have a lot of competitions on home soil, doesn't mean it is any less valuable to the community and UA athletics. Skiing and hockey are apple and oranges. Phantom Dream was disingenuous to state he/she doesn't care about skiing just because he/she can't view all their competitions.
