The SOA said if you want revenue sharing, you must follow what we say and do.\n\nFrom then on, the village council no longer existed, and a ‚Äúcity‚Äù council took over turning to state laws as government decree. Village law and order, and thousands of years of experience, was dismantled.\n\nAs a child in Shaktoolik, the village council and those on it was the heartbeat of the community and everyone behaved as expected. Elders were on these councils and carried on. In my day, homicides and suicides and violent crimes were taboo and not to be condoned. Things have indeed changed for the worse.",

I also know several young women with their children being raised by their parents while they go out and party.  \n\nYou won't find me arguing about bad fathers, but please don't try to convince me that abortions are all the result or rape or male aggression.  And yes, my wife and I know that some children are used to boost income from welfare services (who really can't track where the money is spent).

If the police were convinced the shooter might shoot elsehwere (as well they might have been) it seems to me that following up on the video evidence of the obvious shooter could be done while other police officers were doing further analysis of the folks on the video with a gun out but no obvious connection to the shooting.

When a commissioner engages in grandstanding, personal insults, and nonsensical statements, you have to just roll your eyes; it's a volunteer position and nobody else wants the job so you're stuck. When his behavior escalates into yelling, cursing, disruptions, police visits, and walking out when there is the people's business to be done, the chair has a duty to take action. If her action crossed a legal line there is no excuse for that, but it can be remedied.\nThe chair's intent in calling the executive session was clearly to take the people's business seriously. Maybe she did it wrong, but that doesn't change or excuse her fellow commissioner's inappropriate behavior that she was attempting to address.",

I am a compassionate Canadian and supported that although I dont think we costed it out properly.  However what soon can become a similar number of individuals can just cross from a safe country.  To me this is a loophole - close it.",

Today, at least in 2010,  the upper income .2% in the US  controlled just over 28% of the wealth resources.  I don't know where we are right now but that segment did grow even through the Obama presidency.

In 2004 Keillor explained his own in his book 'HOMEGROWN DEMOCRAT'.\n\nSo, Froggy, for merciless anti-democrat satire, one should of course seek a DIFFERENT satirist, one with Republican or TeaPartyish views: ANOTHER droll writer, ideally as incisive & well-read as Keillor, but with a neo'conservative' outlook. Maybe a pro-Palin version of Calvin Trillin, a conservative satirist I recall from the 90s.\n\nLastly, the huge FOX 'New$' empire could recruit & publish satirists, IF only enough Fox fans really wanted to READ satirists.

Both cases were based on testimony by felons with extensive criminal  records who were also drug users and/or dealers, and who had already earlier in their lives accused others of abuse. In both cases bishops paid the false accusers obscene sums of Catholic people's money. Cardinal Pell is accused by two men who fit the exact same profile, although it remains to be seen whether they will seek Catholic people's church donations.

I was the last SO employee working there, and spent my time trying to keep up the place. The idea was to try to rent or lease the facility, but with the land zoning being for jail use, and the distance out in the woods, we did not get any serious offers. I kept the buildings up the best I could, with ventilation in all the rooms, fire prevention all around, grass cut and watered, all systems working, as well as security. Other employees worked security also, though they were no longer SO employees. With no renters, and no sign of re-opening for inmates, the Sheriff at the time said he would no longer pay for the upkeep, and turned it over to the regular County Parks Dept. After that, I think that maintenance was done only minimally. I put in my 40 per week, and still more was needed, but we had no budget. Hope it sells to someone!",

Why is that happening? The professor attributes it to wage disinflation and he may well be right to a degree but he does not address why the significant price inflation has taken place. Given the extreme competition for available housing, someone has managed to accrue the capital from somewhere. Generational population growth has remained relatively steady and new construction has been commensurate with that growth. Demand, however, is outstripping supply. This is because immigration growth is increasing at three times that of generational growth and many millennials can't compete with their wealth.",

What has happened already is the educational system has been ruined  by funding cuts.  Schools have already cut librarians, nurses, vocational education, PE teachers, teachers at every level .  Last year I was a SMART volunteer at Camas Ridge Elementary school.  They didn't have a librarian and volunteers tried to fill in.  That library was a mess. Can you believe it?  In this era, schools without librarians.  If Measure 97 begins to heal the educational decay, then I am voting for it.",

In Alberta, for example, tax money follows students to Catholic, private, and other sectarian (e.g., Dutch Reformed) schools, as well to district-run and charter public schools.  Students in all of these schools must meet provincial standards, which are assessed in 3rd (optional), 6th and 9th grade (the Province's highest level assessment is PISA). There is an integrated provincial curriculum, along with student, parent, and teacher guides. Schools have the option not to use them. But every year, every school's value-added results (achievement growth above what student demographics would predict) is widely published, and most parents use to make their school choices. So what people here in the US call a \"voucher\" system can, in fact, work well. But multiple design factors are critical to its success.",

In point of fact, Christ rewarded St. Dismas with paradise, for accepting his justice and asking forgiveness.  Mercy can be found in the fact that, despite our sins, as long as we seek forgiveness we can still receive our eternal reward.  In the case of Capital Punishment, executing criminals humanely is an example of mercy.\nIs Capital punishment the reason for high murder rates?  Hardly.  If the death penalty does not act as a deterrent it is because the convicted spends on average 13 years on death row.  If the sentence was carried out swiftly, it might well be a deterrent.  Murder is barbaric.  Its just punishment isn't.  By not carrying out justice the state devalues the lives of the victims.",

When a KW is needed on the demand grid, it must instantly be generated for that demand or the lights don't come on. The regulated power base that we all pay for has to double the investment for back up generation such as natural gas fired processes for wind farms. Secondly they are enormously expensive. Wind and solar are heavily subsidized by tax payers and utility rate payers. Wind alone subsidies  in a $2.50/mmbtu natural gas market amount to $6.25/mmbtu in real cost. this is a fact that is conveniently ignored. This hurts Xcel and their power customers because as the rates for power go up, demand destruction kicks in and Xcel is not selling as much power as they need to grow their business to stay in business. Coal will continue to be a huge part of India and China because they are emerging economies and need cheap energy",

Of course it seems the Democrats put party before country.  Trump is willing to talk with the Dems and has talked to those who accepted his invitations. Unfortunately most haven't which does no one any good. The Democrats will find out eventually that obstructionism will not help their party.  Hopefully they find out before they destroy the country. Dems, you were elected to help the country, not to do what you are doing now. If you care about the country, stop the rhetoric and cooperate, talk, discuss, and get things done.

But in the case of RAPE specifically; (I am aware that child sexual abuse may not be rape in the adult sense ) is there greater clarity that it should be reported to civil authorities. I agree with Cynical Saint that any type of child sexual abuse, should be considered ... rape.

I am hurt that he knelt because of my profession. It has now snowballed to complete political lines being drawn in the sand. \n\nI know Ray Rice was charged with domestic violence.  I saw the video.  Joe Mixon was picked up after he crushed a woman's face.  Ezekiel Elliott is fighting a suspension that was brought on due to domestic violence. \n\nThat is just three of many NFL players convicted of violence. Yet, kids wear their jerseys and suspensions can be appealed.  Cops are assassinated because everyone demonized them publically.  \n\nYOU kneel because you have judged us all.  I refuse to watch another game, not because I believe the players are all violent, bu because they kneel.",

That is about $50.4 million per mile.  HART, if it ever gets finished, will be 20 miles long and at current estimates will cost $500 million per mile, or ten times more per mile than it cost the Japanese to build its new Hokkaido line.

Even after accounting for the smaller offset of respending that $1 through the government economy, cutting the PFD still represents ANOTHER $500 million or so loss to the OVERALL Alaska economy. Yes, it benefits some in the government economy -- which now include the recipients of ‚Ä™#‚ÄéAKOilCredits‚Ä¨ (SMH) -- but using ISER's numbers it is clear that PFD cuts will come at the expense of the OVERALL Alaska economy, making what already is a challenged economic situation even worse.

Hammers, and other tools are used to kill more people according to the FBI's UCR stats and no one is trying to ban those.

The fact is if you could find a way to ban all firearms and actually remove them from society we would be far worse off. Here is why firearms do not take great physical strength to use. Young and old male and female weak and strong can all learn how to use firearms efficiently. That means a 110 pound woman can defend herself equally against a 250 pound athletic man.

What he has done, as a number of previous popes from time to time over the past 2000 years, is to emphasize the ways out from a state of sin to one of forgiveness in the Light of Christ.  He has pushed the bishops to be the pastoral teachers their office was always intended to be - disciples of Jesus.

Yet we fall short in eliminating barriers that keep 15% of the congregation from hearing. 3) Immediate fixes include training lectors, celebrants, and homilists to speak less rapidly, enunciate clearly, and use microphones properly. A Hearing loop won't fix a garbled word. 4) When necessary, qualified sound professionals should be engaged. Acoustics should be part of each church design. I can point to examples where it wasn't. 5) Parish health ministries should be involved.

The more expensive the weapons system, the more money that can be spread around the country for manufacturing jobs.  2. Part of the reason is that there are about four million veterans receiving disability payments.  3. Part of the reason is that countries who don't have as much money to spend (Russia and China for examples), have concentrated on relatively cheap defensive weapons like missiles and may have???  missile systems that are more advanced than the U.S.  4. Cheap development:  With all those U.S. factories over in China for example, it is easy to copy U.S. designs without spending money for development.  5. Potential for instability within the U.S.",

Compared to what you ask?  Well, Obamacare started with the \"assumption\" that there were \"47 million\" people who had no health insurance.  Obamacare \"covered\" about \"27 million\" by expanding Medicaid to pay cover them and raised taxes to pay for this additional cost of around $10 billion.  However, when organized labor (like the ILWU) found out that Obamacare was going to impose a \"Cadillac Tax\" on their generous union healthcare benefits starting at 40%, the proverbial kukai hit the fan.  So now, the taxes are not being collected to pay for Obamacare and only the Federal deficit is getting bigger.  So what is the solution?  The GOP plan may not be great, but at least is being realistic about the situation.  Meanwhile, the Democrats are starting to line up to support the AHCA, because the imposition of the Cadillac Tax is not happening.",

Well, he was in Sudan but the U.S. launched missile strike on this country, an act of war, but failed to hit him. But why did that? Because U.S. suspected he was complicit in the bombing of its embassies in Africa. Yes, suspicion, no proof of direct link. But why bomb the embassies? Because the U.S. installed massive military forces throughout the Arab region including Somalia. Right smack in the middle of Islamic most holy lands. Yes, a repeat of 12-13th centuries Christian crusader war. There you have it. You hit them, they hit you back. \n\nOh yes, the last Christian crusader war lasted 200 years. We still have about 180 years to go on this one.",

The Greens could have put a stop to all these fundraisers by voting for the legislation and voted the BC Liberals out.  The Greens are so far behind the finance eight ball now that if there was an election around the corner,  they are in a really tough bind - makes them unlikely to topple the government even if the NDP runs rough shot over them - a  total tactical miscalculation on the part of Mr. Weaver and the Greens.",

If the ILH doesn't agree with the decision than that should establish their own tournament of some kind.  The state public high schools will be able to continue without the ILH.

If the Chinese sold its dollar assets and saved the money in China, the dollar would depreciate and the Chinese currency appreciate. Therefore, to maintain a weak exchange rate, the Chinese need to keep buying dollar assets. In order to make their goods more competitive, Asian currencies have been forced to devalue to a lower rate vs the US dollar than the yuan. It's basic economics.\n\nThe problem with a weak currency is it creates inflationary pressure. Since China is a big importer of commodities, a weaker exchange rate increases the cost of living and the cost of raw materials. As result, the Chinese Government has allowed a small appreciation in the exchange rate to help mitigate inflationary pressure. They have done this by trying to diversify away from the US dollar, but they still buy dollars.",

I believe Leiken and Bozevich should be thrown out of office and not allowed to be public servants for 10 years or more, and Rob Handy given a special election against Pat Farr.  The Lane County Commissioners who did this are just puppets for the developers, mining and logging industry.  They are suing the state of Oregon to increase logging our public forests.  If we can't get them out NOW; REMEMBER THEM NEXT TIME THEY ARE UP FOR RE-ELECTION!  I respect Rob Handy and his intentions to do his best for the citizens of Lane County.",

While more appealing that Hillary, he is still part of the political establishment that has been plaguing this country for years.\n\nI truly hope for a significant change and the fact that all of the political leaders fear Trump only increases his appeal. Do I think he has a big mouth, yes. Do I think he says things inappropriately at times, yes. But he isn't a politician and that is clear. He has a business mind and runs things like a business. Ultimately, that is what we need. Streamlining and cost reductions like a business. \n\nI just hope he is smart enough to put the right advisers around him.

Perpetrator has access to non-violent options as recourse, but choses to not use them.\n\nAt this point there is zero evidence - none - regarding requirement number one, above.\n\nBy that (very reasonable) definition, Sandy Hook (the school slaughter) was not an act of terrorism. Today's attack may prove to be another Sandy Hook. \n\nAnd, by the way, by that (very reasonable) definition, some of the attacks against soldiers in recent years were also not acts of terrorism, though they were strangely labeled as such by the media (see item two in above definition).",

There was no science behind it, and it was done in  a time when there was little scientific understanding of mental illness.  Mental health medicine was still in the \"dark ages\" then.

They failed to do so, BTW.\n\nAs matt calgary correctly responded, electro-convulsive therapy is a valid treatment that is still used today.

In 2016, we elected Mr. Trump. \nIn 2014 and 2015, Pope Francis gathered the bishops of the world into a synod to discuss the family, then wrote an Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, to focus our ideas and energies on divine mercy. But the divisions among us appear to grow deeper. \nI think Pope Francis has tried everything he knows to bring about change, but we and our world have become so resistant to everything but what we want to hear, it all falls on deaf ears.

How can a HOF QB not prioritize the Offensive LIne? How is that even possible? How this\norginization has fallen so quickly so fast is breathtaking. \nAgain, how a HOF QB can look at Trevor Siemian and say, \"OK, he's our guy. We can win with him\" is utterly surreal. \nI wonder if John watched the game last night. Any similarity between Trevor Siemian and Carson Wentz? No, not, none. But, hey, John is in the HOF. His judgement is infalliable. Sure it is.",

We look at solar activity, volcanism and albedo changes, teleconnections and ocean current changes, land use impacts and carbon cycle changes, changes in atmospheric composition, and more.

Led by the most corrupt president in history, they are not even going to pretend that they intend to be governed by ethical concerns. \nAs for the ACA: every time a Republican repeated the mantra, \"Repeal and Replace\", s/he was lying.

A year-round shelter tied into social service providers and addiction treatment programs would be a major step toward the reduction of homelessness in Eugene, assuming there are even greater efforts on the part of the City to provide affordable housing for those in need.

True, Christianity is often misunderstood or misrepresented but the Bible is a very complex book inspired by an all-wise, all-knowing G-d and it is an art to try to distill it into simple truths.  The appeal is a return to morality and righteousness which I think you share?  G-d grants us freedom to choose what we or in whom we want to believe but if one professes to be a Christian then there is a code of conduct as informed by the Bible that one should aspire to.  The Bible teaches that G-d loves the sinner (every single human being) regardless of background, association etc, and desires them all to come to the saving knowledge of the Messiah.  And if one chooses to follow the Messiah then one must repent from certain acts that G-d finds offensive.  Association comes with obligations, in any sphere of life!

They recognised the importance of free expression, and also of keeping the peace. \n\nSo if you dress up in riot gear, head over to a rally with your pals similarly kitted out, knowing that there's going to be trouble, and if you then charge a bunch of people with the intent of seriously injuring them simply because they subscribe to ideas that you personally hate, who are the villains?

The Militia Act of 1903 divided the militia into what was called the organized militia, what is now the National Guard and the unorganized militia, consisting of all males from ages 17 to 45, with the exception of certain officials and others, which is codified in 10 U.S.C 311.

I can give you plenty of examples where it was liberal sexual views and clergy sexual activity that became systemic and allowed abuse to occur and continue. If people doubt this as a possibility then I rest my case in regard to the problems that occur when we fail to account for psychological causes, as well as historical shifts in approaches to sexual behaviour.
