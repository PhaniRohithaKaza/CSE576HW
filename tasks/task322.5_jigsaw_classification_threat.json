Religion has been proven throughout history to be undemocratic and divisive. In the 60's and 70's boomers exposed the threat to democracy posed by religion, militarism, corporatism, elitism, imperialism, and royalty. Unfortunately, with the UK and the US as our masters and role models, they all returned. \n   The best examples of genuine democracies on the planet are the Scandinavian social democracies, nations that tolerate religious freedom but encourage freedom from religion.\n  Neither a person nor a nation can effectively embrace everything and anything.

Also, in addition to genetic forces, there are undoubtedly cultural influences to many gender-related activities (for example, it is doubtful that the propensity to shave one's legs is genetically determined). It is therefore likely as wrong to attribute all gender differences to acculturation as it is to attribute them all to genetics.

As a result, drivers who are perfectly safe run the risk of being unfairly convicted of impaired driving, while drivers who are stoned can often escape conviction if they have a good lawyer.\" from Mother Jones....\n\n The testing has \"caught up\" with the issue and there are now tests which will detect \"recent\" use of marijuana...i.e. is the person impaired because of marijuana use.

Mahar was innocent and deserving, no doubt about it, but two differences go the other way: \n\n1. Arar was only 16 when Canadian officials interrogated him while he was being tortured, and turned over results to the Americans. Arar was 32.\n\n2. Arar was held for 1 year. Khadr was in Guantanamo for 10. The actions of our officials contributed to that, and to his 'guilty plea'. \n\nIt took a little over 4 years from the start of Arar's mistreatment for him to receive compensation and an apology - not speedy.  However, in Khadr's case, it has taken 14 years (13 since he started his lawsuit).  That's not exactly a \"panic\" to settle.\n\nThe Harper government could undoubtedly have made a settlement 10 years ago to return him to Canada and pay perhaps a hundred thousand dollars in damages.  Instead they ran up millions in losing court costs.",

Lumber companies bid for tracts of land to harvest and an auction thereby establishing the 'market price' to be paid to the private landowner. In Canada, Atlantic Canada excluded, the Crown owns the land and sets the 'stumpage fee' that a company must pay in order to harvest. The U.S. feels stumpage rates are below the 'market price' used in the U.S. thereby conferring an unfair advantage to Canadian companies.\n\nI'll just throw an idea out here. Why can't Canadian stumpage fees track the U.S. 'market price' the way that ETF's or mutual funds track a market index? I suppose Provincial Governments need revenue certainty, but surely there must be a way. Otherwise we continue on as we have with no resolution in sight.\n\nhttp://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/ResearchPublications/tips/tip98-e.htm",

The problems, beginning with the ANC and the patronage networks that have manifested within their ranks, are deep rooted. With Zuma gone, it will probably be business as usual for the ANC elite as too many people are compromised along with him. It will be like substituting the mafia don.

So Christie Clark dumped the cost of their infrastructure on them directly. Ridings which favoured Christy's Liberals, like Kelowna, got their infrastructure projects paid for out of general revenue.\n\nPolitics aside, there's good reasons for a government to spread infrastructure costs over all its constituents.

There are faux-meat dishes in Asian restaurants that have just as long of a history as the meat-equivalent dishes themselves. To say that seitan has to be 100% like beef is ridiculous. \n\nSecond, as many have pointed out, the point of a sloppy or diner food joint catering to vegans is because vegans don't SIMPLY PREFER BROCCOLI - they have cravings for oily, rich, and textured foods other than vegetables the same as meat eaters. The reason they eat non-meat things is for ETHICAL reasons.

Those other states are similarly underpopulated and therefore considered to be an unattractive market for insurers.  I can't speak specifically to the other states, but there has been a constant struggle in Alaska to find insurers willing to provide taxi insurance to this market.  Taxis in Fairbanks went from charging $1/mile to over $3/mile in a relatively short span, which is directly attributable to the constant rise of insurance premiums.  When Uber finally gets established and folks realize that their personal insurance without commercial endorsements just won't cut it, I have to wonder if they will be similarly taken to the cleaners by the insurance companies.",

I stated that mankind is contributing significantly to the rise in CO2 levels, but that doesn't mean that I put an exact percentage on it or that it's the only thing contributing to CO2 levels.  There is data that supports that CO2 levels have been rising and falling naturally over time.  All I am saying is the activities of mankind are accelerating it because what we breathe out and our activities that contribute to the further production of CO2 and the lessening of plants and trees that convert CO2 into oxygen cannot have a zero effect on the total amount of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The majors have a history of  strong bond ratings and staying to clean up the problems we hope do not happen. I am concerned that Hilcorp Alaska LLC or another company with an Alaska specific LLC will close operations and not be there in case of a large problem.... Will they have the resources?

The compartmentalization pervades everything beyond mid-level management.\n\nSo, a woman can have smarts, but not the \"right kind\" of smarts for certain kinds of roles.   This is insidious and career development and training decisions reflect it.   This starts at lower levels, and ultimately becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because the women don't have all the right training for senior roles in more technical areas before they reach the point of being serious contenders for senior roles.

Now imagine crossing a border of a forgein nation to get CDN goods to the Pacific.  Imagine doing the same to get goods from the Pacific.  Thats right an isolated BC.  Straight Rolandx, Alberta still gives Canada 10 billion more than it gets back PERIOD.  You cant tax a forgein nation, so they AB keeps it all.  Our oil, gas, coal, beef, grains all sell to the world\n  BEST the US depends on Ab oil, just in case anyone attempted to stop its flow, guess they would have to convince our biggest buyer.  Still think you hold the cards roland? My guess is an isolated BC and overtaxed Sask would tire of having to pick up the rasom payments to Quebec would leave next.  Then it would only leave bright ideas Ontario to bribe Quebec.  2nd largest oil reserves in the world GONE. Think maybe the USA would be interested in AB? I do.",

Progressives did not ascribe fascism to the right until after the ovens were discovered in Poland and Germany.

I believe if journalists wish to be taken seriously, they need to report the news, seriously.  Not rolling their eyes  or raising an eyebrow. There are ample editorialists for that.  Walter Cronkite was a liberal, but he was one of the best newsmen in history, in my opinion. I think it would behoove all journalists, everywhere, to study that man and emulate his presentation of the news.(BTW I do know \"War of the Worlds\" was a radio show...)",

So what does everyone think happens to those countless other dogs and what happens to the elite ones no longer used for racing? Mushing is a very costly endeavor with 90% ownership who would NOT consider themselves wealthy by any means. There are some great and truly committed mushers who care for their dogs for a life time. I have been fortunate to have know a few. However, too many competitive and recreational mushers view these pets as objects to fulfill short term dreams and  goals without taking on the life expectancy of the dogs into account. While some of these dogs find great homes,  too many end up in unwanted ones and are abused because they were not raised as pets/indoor dogs or end up in shelters where they are euthanized.",

There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\n\n\"Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.\"\n\nPeople who can't find the science aren't looking.

A carbon pricing policy does not automatically reduce emissions, success depends on the policy's stringency.

If I wait four years to 65, I need to take $32,000 (4 x $8,000) out of my investment accounts to spend the same as if I opted to collect CPP now. By waiting to 65, I get a CPP that's $3,300 more per year, PLUS the inflation adjustment each following year that is based on a larger base. For financial purposes I plan to live to 94 (then sell the house). In my case, CPP at 65 actually puts less strain on my investment accounts. They would run out at age 91 if I collected now but if I wait to 65 I'd still have a cushion left at age 94 — spending the same amount. How's that possible?

So, in that spirit:\nWhy would a prideful, supposedly accomplished physicist and highly regarded emeritus professor not be consorting with those of similar expertise instead of straining to establish his anonymous bona fides here for most of his waking hours every day of the week with strangers who do not matter to him one whit? Or are they all he has left?",

Hence the clamor for change and hope which was either not understood or simply ignored by the political leaders.  Therefore the voters who opted for change no matter what put Donald Trump in the driver seat.   Second, we the people individually or communally have not been seriously involved with our government.  We just let things go. So there we are.  Good or bad, we deserve the kind of leaders and government we have.  If we have to blame someone or something, blame ourselves.

If they find that the person is a veteran, they help them get hooked in with using VA services and benifits.

During the Cold War the USSR was our enemy, but no one I knew considered the Russian people as their enemy.  It was the government with which they had issues.\n\nBut, it would have been helpful if you had included your caveat of exemption at the beginning.  \n\nAs for the RCC, many of their members \"advocate\" their church's understanding of theology, but have not yet been exposed to the truth.

The only thing such persons respect is physical force. If you attempt to negotiate, they will likely regard you as a lesser species worthy of scorn and physical abuse.\nSo yes, under certain circumstances, attempting to negotiate is a bad thing if you want to survive. Fighting to the death with whatever you have available, hopefully a loaded gun,  is your only viable option. Relying on the police to rescue you is foolish.

It just happened to be over the topic or situation of slavery. Even Robert E Lee said they should have freed the slaves before going to war because slavery was on the way out. Also, he didn't want to confuse the reasoning for going to war. Just look around did the north win or did the south lose. Between the debt, federal control and so on I think America lost. I wish slavery never happened. I used that as an analogy.

Just put stops along the street.  The rail would still have to follow street lights, but with it's own dedicated lane, there should be no traffic back up.

Compare previous pictures of truly high speed crashes & the end result looks like the car was compressed into an unrecognizable solid body or ripped apart.  Those extremely large pillars & installing a curb that close to a highway is NOT standard practice in the US or most 1st world countries for good reason.  Unfortunately there will be more of these type of accidents/deaths along Farrington highway & you cannot automatically blame it on reckless speeding.",

We mourn what we think in our heads about her most of which is likely fiction. Our memories are tinged by the time and place of their making, and hindsight. Those who can truly mourn are friends, and family and those who actually knew her or where influenced by something she did. For the rest of us, we aren't mourning a reality, just imaginings of who we thought or wanted her to be.Diana was turned into a tabloid story that made $$$ for media.

Then one of the mothers of the teens showed up asking why teens can't have fun.

This loss of belief is often ignored by Catholics, as people cite the scandal, the hot-button doctrines of the day, the liturgy and several other things, contributing factors but not the fundamental one.  \n\nThere is a difference between losing belief in a  institution and losing belief in God. That distinction is often lost in these discussions. The study shows that the majority of \"nones\"  believe in God, many pray.  \n\nIt is doubtful that having someone wish them Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas caused anyone to lose their belief in the doctrines of Christianity. Also, I am unaware of laws that forbids people from mentioning God in public. God is mentioned in public all the time in the US. But there are places where it is not permitted - public schools for example.  Once again, it is doubtful that this causes loss of belief.",

From Juneau those same instructors require higher cost just to get to Anchorage before gong to those communities.  Anchorage and the Mat-Su is the largest concentration of teachers in the state. There are more teacher positions in Anchorage than in all of South East. \n\nMaking UAS the Education Center will put more staff, instructors, professors at a campus with minimal facilities. Building more facilities in Juneau when Anchorage has existing facilities is just not financially responsible.    \n\nUAS should continue to participate with UAA and UAF  in providing teacher education programs. Turning the entire teacher education program over to one campus is a dire mistake",

Eliminate their \"we fly home every Friday and back on Monday\" habit - they get one round-trip ticket per session if they're outside the local commute area. Eliminate staff travel - once they're in Anchorage there's plenty of local people available.\n\nOnce you do stuff like that, ask Revenue what kind of tax they can implement with no additional staff. It won't be much, I bet. Want an income tax? It'll end up being a flat tax (no staff to deal with anything more involved). Change the oil and business tax mess to be a flat 1% of all revenue, no deductions. (You just made it cheaper to pay the tax than try to avoid it.) Eliminate a bunch of staff attorneys, paralegals, etc. that do nothing but deal with oil taxes.",

We spread the good news, the full evangelion, and that leads us back to the Eucharist. At some point an enquirer must come to Mass.\n\nBut parishes where we can take friends or enquirers to Mass without shame or embarrassment are few and those where the Mass reflects the beauty of the Gospel and draw people deeper into the mystery of Christ's life, death, and resurrection are fewer still.\n\nThe circle closed in on itself, the emphasis on \"gathering\" over worship and sacrifice, the lack of awe and reverence, and the deliberate ugliness that resulted from disobedience to Vatican II 's teachings sabotage evangelism.

To me that is the shame of purpose.  Those who accept the knowledge afforded us by science is due solely because it is warranted by evidence.  At any time the evidence or proof is found wanting and void of support, science changes, admits its mistakes, and adapts to the findings.  I hope and intend to do the same.  My quest is to respond accurately and currently with information.  I too want to know what is in agreement with reality and hold onto what I say only as long as what I think and say is supported by facts.

Hasn’t Civil Beat extensively reported on the fact the FTA has already decided to withhold additional dollars above the $600M because the City has failed to explain how the Rail will be funded, completed, and operated? Even if the FTA took the draconian step (possibly unprecedented?) of requiring the full reimbursement of the $600M - despite the progress and the far more significant local investment that has been made in the Project to date - perhaps it’s a reasonable concept for the City to pay the FTA back $600M if it saves the tax-payer billions of dollars in construction costs for more heavy rail and hundreds of millions in operating costs into the future.",

Getting such a visa petition approved does not permit one to remain here.  One must apply for and get permanent residence to remain.  If one is not in lawful status, one cannot apply for permanent residence in the US, but must leave the country to process abroad.

So she claimed that she  had never consummated her marriage to Arthur. She also got her nephew, Charles II, to oppose the annulment. Charles, who disliked Henry both personally and politically, was happy to oblige his aunt.\n\nAmong other things, Charles was King of Naples. Naples and the Papal States had recently had a war. The pope lost, and didn't want a rerun. So he pretended to take Catherine's claim seriously.\n\nHenry forced his hand when he broke with Rome. That's why the annulment was denied.",

Clinton staged rallies in big cities in the midwest with rock stars and other sports and Hollywood celebrities to warm up the crowd, but  didn't even bother to show up in Wisconsin at all.

A pneumatic airgun doesn't recoil so you can really notice how you are pulling or pushing the gun. Another way is a laser training cartridge that allows you to use your firearm for training and helps out a lot to get the feel of the trigger. Its amazing how much goes into shoot accurately. \n\nTarget shooting in general is very rewarding.

It seems to me that Ms. McLaren thinks that taking ballet class will make a boy more \"girlish\".\nMy son is 11, loves his favourite pair of holey track pants, his scooter and his WiiU. He has also just started his first year at a boarding school in a professional ballet program. HIS choice and HIS dream, and I support him. \nI've met all the boys in his class and for the most part, they are not \"girlish\" at all. Just like any other class or group of kids, they lie somewhere on a spectrum.\nI guess I shouldn't automatically take this as a slight on the ballet world, but you madam, are feeding into the stereotype of male ballet dancers being effeminate or \"girlish\". I think his classmates as well as male dancers in general may take offence. \nPS. Your boy will be forced to learn to deal with bullies if he keeps dancing. Is bullying boyish or girlish?",

The underlying ideology of populists can be left, right, or center. (Wikipedia)\nBoth traditional parties were thrown out in the first vote, therefore the rise of both Le Pen and Macron are due to a surge in populist sentiment. Whether one is \"bad\" and one is \"good\" depends on your political point of view. You can argue from different political perspectives about what the public wants, but it is certainly not more of the same.

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

Those rules are in place so that one group can't legally create an unfair advantage or disadvantage for various groups. No one is forcing this woman to provide her service, but if she chooses to do it for money, then she can't discriminate any more than the owner of an apartment complex can.\n\nBy the way, fighting for civil rights does indeed have consequences at the ballot box.

The main point of my initial comment was that many dire predictions made by Trump's opponents prior to the election did not come true so far. As for lobbyists and spokespersons for various industries, they always try to position the businesses they represent for maximum advantage, understandably enough. However, that doesn't necessarily mean all their warnings are always realistic. In any case, Obama hasn't been president for a while now, so giving him full credit for good economic news under the Trump administration, while refusing to give Trump any credit for this does seem somewhat unfair, at least to me, and in keeping with the general double standards applied by many to these two politicians.",

The complaint about the US embargo remains deflection and bovine scat.  Castro could have sided with the USSR but not adopted that crippling political/economic system.  Does anyone ever discuss that?

Number of employees?  Three, seemingly.   Accomplishments?  The EDC is at the end of year three of a 5-year contract with the County, its main funder.  In those 3 years, it claims to have achieved investment of $1.25 million (contract calls for at least $75 million) and creation of 38 jobs (contract calls for 500).\n\nAlan, I have never seen any \"for\" arguments for the EDC, aside from a weird kind of magical thinking that gets expressed every time a governmental body needs to justify the donation of some lump of public money to it.

In order to cover pre-existing conditions, you have to both have a mandate and subsidies, otherwise only the very ill/diseased will sign up and premiums will be too high for almost everyone. So, community rating means getting the bulk of the community in the pool.\n\nIn order to pay for the necessary subsidies, there had to be increased taxes on the very wealthy. Most people with an ounce of compassion find a small increase in taxes on millionaires and billionaires to be worthwhile in the cause of providing health insurance, and thus health care, to nearly all Americans.\n\nOther details deal with the minimum standards of policies and better coverage at lower cost for mid-level plans. These are nice add-ons, but don't change the logic.\n\nAny GOP plan that messes with any of the critical parameters is going to fail, full stop.
