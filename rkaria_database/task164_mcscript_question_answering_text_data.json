            "input": "Passage: I enjoy making coffee so it 's a fairly complex process but it is easy to make coffee . I already have a coffee machine that makes espresso - the dark black coffee - and also steams and froths milk , which is a separate attachment . To prepare for making my coffee , I fill a coffee cup half full of milk . I usually grind two grinders full of beans at once and keep the ground coffee in an airtight container , so I do n't have to grind it every time . I take a couple tablespoons of the grinds and put them in the basket that then is inserted into the coffee maker . Next I turn on the coffee maker and when it indicates it 's ready , place the mug of milk under the attachment and let it froth the milk until it is hot - usually one or two minutes . Finally , I press the button to have hot water run through the coffee grinds , running the coffee into the mug of frothed milk then turn off the coffee machine and enjoy . Question: When did they take whole beans to grind them? Option1: after frothing the milk. Option2: before making coffee",
            "output": "before making coffee",
            "explanation": "The answer is Option2 since it is mentioned in the passage that they first take two grinders full of beans at once."

            "input": "Passage: So cleaning the kitchen has to happen on a regular basis because the kitchen can get quite dirty from cooking food for meals like breakfast , lunch , and dinner . I first start by getting all the dishes organized and ready to be washed in the sink . I like to place all the cups together , all the bowls together , and all the silverware together so that it 's easier to wash . Then I fill the second sink with just hot water so that I can rinse my dishes after I wash them in the soapy water . I then take one of my nice washcloths and get that ready to start scrubbing some dirty dishes . So I first put all the silverware into the sink so that they can soak . After the cups have been washed I move to washing the bowls and plates . I just scrub all the food particles off the dishes and then dunk them into the rinse water and then I put them up to dry on our above sink dryer rack . After all the plates and bowls are washed I move on to washing the pots and pans that we dirtied at dinner . My husband and I always end up getting food all over the counter tops . After I clean the food off the counter tops I move on to cleaning off the stove . Sometimes when the stove is really dirty I have to use a scrub brush to get some of the food off of the stove . The final thing I do to clean the kitchen is mop the kitchen floor or scrub the kitchen floor by hand . Question: When did they throw in the cups? Option1: After they soak the silverware.

            "input": "Passage: My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport .  But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours .  It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go .  Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops .  The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas . Question: Who was pretty happy to finally leave on the flight? Option1: he was Option2: my wife and I",
            "output": "my wife and I",
            "explanation": "The answer is Option2: my wife and I because while the passage directly does not mention this as a fact, it provides facts like I am glad I paid extra money for making no-stops and also says that the wife hates to fly. Thus, one can infer that both of them were glad to leave the flight and had a great time in Vegas."
