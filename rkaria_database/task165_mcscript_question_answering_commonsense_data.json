            "input": "Passage: Cleaning the kitchen is n't very fun , but it 's important . Yesterday , we had to clean the kitchen and there were a lot of aspects involved . First , we had to clean the kitchen sink . Next , we had to get a mop to clean the floor . The floor needed extra soapy warm water to get all the stains out . The next thing we cleaned was the refrigerator . After that , we cleaned the stove and oven . The stove and oven are combined , so we cleaned the outside with warm water and towels . After we finished , the whole thing was sparkling . I was so excited to be done with cleaning the kitchen because it 's nice to cook in a clean kitchen ! Question: what was full of food? Option1: the fridge Option2: oven",
            "output": "the fridge",
            "explanation": "The answer is is fridge since the passage talks about cleaning the kitchen. Of all the aspects like kitchen floor, refrigerator, stove and oven, only the refrigerator (which is a synonym of fridge) is naturally expected to be full of food. Oven's can be full of food but that means that the oven is usually too hot to be cleaned."

            "input": "Passage: I had to get up this morning and get the coffee ready . While it was waiting , I fed the cat , and made sure she was n't near the front door , because I did n't want to let her out . The paper usually came before I woke up anyway , so I did n't have any trouble finding it outside . I saw a light-colored plastic bag , which is usually what they came in , and could see the newspaper through the bag . I had to wear sunglasses just to go out for about 30 seconds , because I did n't think my eyes would be able to take it . I was glad when I took the paper out of the bag as I walked inside . It was much drier than the one I had gotten the day before ! Question: What was close to the sidewalk this time? Option1: The cat. Option2: Probably the newspaper.",
            "output": "Probably the newspaper.",
            "explanation": "The correct answer is newspaper since the paper mention that while waiting for the coffee to get ready, they fed the cat since they didnt wanter to let her out. This implies that the cat was inside the house. Since sidewalks are not inside houses, by the process of elimination, the only option remainin tis Option1."

Option1: dishwasher Option2: in the sink",
            "output": "in the sink",
            "explanation": "The passage mentions that the people cleaned the kitchen by starting with the kitchen sink. Cleaning the kitchen sink implies that there were dirty dishes in the sink. Thus, while both options can contain dirty dishes, given that the sink was cleaned, it is more likely that Option2: in the sink is the correct answer here."

            "input": "Passage: Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: Who started beating the eggs? Option1: mailman Option2: the narrator",
            "output": "the narrator",

            "output": "in the bowl",

            "output": "salt and pepper",
